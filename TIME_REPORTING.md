# Time reporting

As Radial typically contracts on a time and materials basis, accurate time tracking is important to upholding accountability and improving project planning.  This document defines how time should be tracked and what is billable or unbillable.

### When to clock in and out

Clock in as soon as you reach the office and immediately before leaving for the day.  Treat any time you work from home the same way.  In general you should leave the clock running for short breaks (bio breaks, coffee breaks, etc.) of approximately 15 minutes or less.  When leaving the office (e.g. for lunch) you should generally clock out as well excepting working lunches such as sales meetings with potential clients where business is the main thing discussed.  While taking care of personal work is certainly acceptable at the office, it is expected that this will also be done off the clock.

### Billable vs. unbillable time

Billable time is any time working on a single client project.  This includes any meetings or preparation work. Record all time on the project regardless of your perceived productivity.  If you have any doubts about whether a block of time should be billable, discuss it with the project lead.

Unbillable time may be in one of several categories and is to be recorded the same way as billable.  The categories are:

 - **Administrative**: Anything relating to the management of the company (e.g. all hands meetings).
 - **Sales & Business Networking**: Anything relating to sales or recruiting.
 - **Marketing**: Campaigns, research, and Outreach (Events, guests, and free code reviews)
 - **Hack Time**: Time spent on personal projects or continuing education.
 - **[specific company initiatives]**: from time to time unbillable job codes may be assigned to specific internal projects.
