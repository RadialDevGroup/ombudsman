# Customer Guide - Get Your App in the Apple App and Google Play Stores

Any client in need of a mobile application will need two separate developer accounts

- One for iOS (Apple Developer)
- One for Android (Google Play Developer)

This guide outlines steps to get started doing this. There are separate steps for Apple and Google Play stores.

## Designate someone to set up the accounts

For both iOS and Android, you should designate someone in a position of authority in the organization to go through the steps to set up developer accounts.

This person should be able to authorizing spending on behalf of the organization (inputting credit card information, etc)

This person should be able to select and/or create an Apple ID on behalf of the organization, and fill in details specific to the organization for creating an Apple Developer Account.

This person should be able to select and/or create a Google account on behalf of the organization, and fill in details specific to the organization for creating a Google Developer Account.

# iOS

## Developer Account Setup

You will needs an iOS Developer Account to publish an app on the Apple App Store.

First, you will need to go create an [Apple developer account](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/).

Unless there is a strong reason for you to enroll as an individual, you will need to enroll as an organization.

*You should only enroll as an individual if you are a sole proprietor or single person business.

IMPORTANT

The Apple ID you create or use for the developer account will be used throughout the app development process. The app will be linked to this Apple ID. The Apple ID you select to use can be created specifically for this account, or you can use an existing Apple ID.

*You may not want to use your personal Apple ID, but rather one that is affiliated with your organization. You cannot use an Apple ID that is already used to distribute other media types besides apps (movies, TV, books, music).

### iOS Developer Account Enrollment requirements (for an organization)

When setting up the developer account the designated person at your company/organization will pay Apple $99 and input the organization details including a D-U-N-S number.

If you do not have a D-U-N-S number, [here](https://developer.apple.com/support/D-U-N-S/) is some info from Apple on getting one.

This person will then fill out some contact information and verify information about the company as a part of creating the developer account.

This [step-by-step tutorial](https://mobileroadie.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200091736-iOS-Developer-Account-Step-by-Step-Guide) walks you through the process (but may be somewhat outdated because Apple regularly changes its process)

You then need to wait for the Apple Developer Account to be approved. (24+ hours)

- [Prepare or decide on marketing materials for your app](#marketing)

### iTunes Connect Setup

After the Apple Developer Account is approved, your next step is to [set up your iTunes Connect account](https://developer.apple.com/support/itunes-connect/).

You will use the Apple ID you associated with the developer account to do this.

### Add Radial Developers As Administrators

After you have set up ITunes Connect, you should ask the members of your development team for their Apple IDs.

You will then add members of the Radial Developer team to the iTunes Connect account as administrators. You will use their Apple ID to do this.

IMPORTANT

- The Apple ID of each Radial Developer may NOT be their Radial email.

#### Test Flight - external testers

You should then add up to 30 external beta testers in (Test Flight)[https://developer.apple.com/testflight/]
Test Flight can be found in iTunes Connect. Add external testers using their email addresses.

# Android

## Developer Account Setup
You will need an Android developer account to publish to the Google Play store.

Select the Google Account to associate with your developer account.

Sign in to the Google Play console with this account.

Follow the instructions to set up a developer account.

This costs $25 at this time.

After going through this process you will await an email notification from Google that will notify you that your account is ready to be activated. In the meantime, see [While You Wait](#while_you_wait).

### Add Radial Developers To your Google Developer Account.
Use the [name]@radialdevgroup.com account to add Radial Developers to your Play Account.

# Other Activities

## <a name="beta_testers"></a>Develop your list of Beta Testers

While you wait for your Apple Developer Account to be approved, we recommend developing two lists of beta testers. One list will be for Android, the other for iOS.

You'll need a set of emails for anyone willing to be a beta tester for your app.

IMPORTANT

- Your Android beta testers must have Android phones.
- Your iOS beta testers must have iPhones.
- If you can get a range of different phones on your beta test lists (iPhone X to iPhone SE, Samsung Galaxy 6 through Google Pixel 2, for example) that is best.

## <a name="marketing"></a>Select Marketing Materials

Apps in beta testing or production need marketing materials that consist of screenshots and description.

We can provide screenshots.

You need to provide descriptions for the App Store and Play Stores.

Apple is picky about descriptions. Please read the following to aid you in coming up with an app description for the Apple App Store.

- [Product page](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/product-page/)
- [App Store Review](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#accurate-metadata)
- [Marketing guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/#)

Google is less picky. Here are their guidelines.

You can send your descriptions to the team working on your project.
