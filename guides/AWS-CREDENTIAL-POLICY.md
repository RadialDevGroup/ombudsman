# Intent

This policy is intended to clarify the credential issueanace and access policy for AWS.  Access will be given on a per-developer or per-project basis.  Credentials will be issued for production, staging, and test environments, and to individual developers with access to development buckets.

# Process

New Hires should be issued a new personal credential.  Add them to all development groups.  Access to production/staging buckets can be authorized on an as-needed basis. Also add the list-buckets group and the changepassword group.

Give users console access and set an auto-generated password.  Issue credentials and communicate them via slack.
