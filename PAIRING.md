# Pairing
## Intents and Values
As a company, meeting our commitment to producing quality software in a timely fashion for our clients depends on well-tested agile development techniques.

## Pair Programming
Collaborative process can enhance developer productivity and provide significant benefits for quality software engineering.  Pair programming often provides beneficial realtime collaborative feedback during creative phases of the practical development process.

## Resource assignments
When available, developers will be assigned to projects in pairs.  Periodically pairing teams may be changed in order to incorporate different strengths and points of view to each team.  When resources are not available to pair, it is still recommended to try to "pair with yourself" to keep progress moving forward, or otherwise "stop the assembly line" and seek help from someone else if blocked.

## General Process

- Start the process by reviewing the feature that needs to be completed.  Attempt to identify any potential blockers or break down the feature if it appears to be too complex.
- For each time period, each programmer will either be a driver or observer.  Each programmer should get an equal amount of time participating in either activity, regardless of familiarity with the software and hardware platform being used and its effect on progress.  The purpose of handing off responsibilities is to allow either developer to learn and provide insight to problems which is not possible if (they) are not allowed to take control at some point.
- At times, a developer may lose focus, and it should be the responsibility of the other developer to recognize this and discuss the situation to find a solution.  Try using Pomodoro (sp?) to prevent focus from being lost as time progresses.
