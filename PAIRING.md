# Pairing

## Intents and Values

As a company, meeting our commitment to producing quality software in a timely fashion for our clients depends on well-tested agile development techniques.

## Pair Programming

Collaborative process can enhance developer productivity and provide significant benefits for quality software engineering.  Pair programming often provides beneficial realtime collaborative feedback during creative phases of the practical development process.

## Resource assignments

When available, developers will be assigned to projects in pairs.  Periodically pairing teams may be changed in order to incorporate different strengths and points of view to each team.  When resources are not available to pair, it is still recommended to try to "pair with yourself" to keep progress moving forward, or otherwise "stop the assembly line" and seek help from someone else if blocked.

## General Process

* Start the process by reviewing the feature that needs to be completed.  Attempt to identify any potential blockers or break down the feature if it appears to be too complex.

* For each time period, each programmer will either be a driver or navigator.  Each programmer should get an equivalent amount of time participating in either activity, regardless of familiarity with the software and hardware platform being used and its effect on progress.  The purpose of handing off responsibilities is to allow each developer to learn and provide insight to problems which is not possible if unable to take control at some point.

* At times, a developer may lose focus, and it should be the responsibility of the other developer to recognize this and discuss the situation to find a solution.  Try using [Pomodoro technique][pom] to prevent focus from being lost as time progresses.

## Optimizations

* When the driver has greater knowledge of the task at hand, forging ahead at full speed may actually be counterproductive.  Drivers should slow down and explain the reasons and techniques used to complete the task so that navigators can maintain an understanding of the project throughout.

* When the navigator has greater knowledge of the task at hand, simply dictating to the driver as if operating a voice-to-text editor may be detrimental to the value of pair programming.  Navigators should describe the intended implementation rather than specify exact edits, and when it is necessary to specify exact edits the navigator should explain why.

* When either pairing partner has questions about the current approach, that partner should raise those questions both to ensure the pair stays on the same page and to prompt more productive thinking about the software development process.

# Pair Programming

## Solutions Provided By Pairing

* Pairing provides continuous interviewgration (id est: continuous integration for code reviews)

* Pairing helps keep code moving, as one programmer may start driving when the other feels drained.

* Pairing helps programmers learn from each other in the process of producing code.

* Pairing helps improve code quality on the first pass by ensuring realtime feedback, rather than forcing lengthy eye-glazing sessions of missing most of the details across forty-seven files with thousands of changes during a code review after the fact.  Note to self: finish that code review.

* Pairing helps ensure that more than one person understands the codebase.

* Pairing provides excellent opportunities for coders to pause and discuss abstract concerns, where otherwise they may not ever both have a good stopping point at the same time.


## Problems Solved By Pairing

* Infer from the solution statements.


## Method For Detecting Problems Pairing Can Solve

Does it involve programming?  Do you have more than one programmer available?  Is someone willing to pay for both of them to sit in front of the computer and work together on the same code at the same time?  Are you pretty sure they will not kill each other?

If you answer to all of these questions, or at least most of them, is "yes" . . . make a list of all the problems associated with this project and label them "solved by pair programming".


## Plan For Implementing Pair Programming Practice, Putting Problems Pat

1. Buy a computer and a desk.

2. Buy two monitors, two keyboards, and two rodents.

3. Set these things up together, all connected in one big snarl of wires, with the monitors both showing the same stuff.

4. Chain two programmers to the desk, preferably each with a chair.

5. Tell them to pick a driver and a navigator.

6. Tell them to switch roles frequently.

7. Tell them to take periodic breaks.

8. Tell them to communicate, so that nobody gets left behind and anyone who has questions or ideas can contribute to the process, whether driving or navigating.

9. Get out of their way.

10. Observe results and write a smug, self-satisfied blog post about it.

11. Use that blog post as marketing to get clients to pay you more money.

12. . . .

13. Profit!


## The Real Answer

Most of the above is nonsense written by someone who's trying to spark his imagination, because he isn't getting anywhere today.  So far, that inspiration tactic does not seem to be working.
