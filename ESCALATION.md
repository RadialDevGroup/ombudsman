# Escalation

## Intent
Within a client engagement, issues arrise that may need to be addressed by someone else: the problem may be technical, relate to customer recovery, be related to sales or process, or may be an issue that a developer has with a client.  It is important that the steps for communicating these details be clear and consistent to ensure that vital customer communication occurs

## Methodology
Apologize if the customer is unhappy and assure them that we will do whatever we can to resolve their issues. If it is within your power, please accomodate customer requests. It is not productive to argue with a customer as to whether they were wronged. If possible, be completely transparent. If we have erred, please get another person involed, internally. We will correct the error.  We will not work for free. We will not refund the client unless that is the only reasonable remedy.  In most cases, we will offer the client credit, work in kind, etc, in order to resolve their issue.  If we cannot immediately remedy the issue, we should tell the client the reason for any delay.

## Technical Support
- Issues with equipment or Human Resources should be sent to Marshall Smith and Ben West.
- Consistent issues should be reported via bug onto the policy document
- Marshall and Ben will divide resposiblities in resolving these issues, delegating them as neccessary

## Blockers and Issues.
- If an story is blocked, mark it as block in the relevant issue tracker.
- If the tracker does not support marking the issue blocked, assign it to Ben or Marshall and mention them on it.
- If Ben or Marshall is not on the project and does not have access to the issue tracker (This should literally not happen), please create an item on the Radial Sprint.ly, tag it with your project name, and assign it to Ben or Marshall, and mention them on the item with the reason that you are blocked.

## Customer Recovery
- If a customer is not satisfied with a deliverable, product, or process, please notify Ben or Marshall immediately, via email and in-person, if possible.
- All relevant information should be forwarded to management
- If possible, a resolution to the customer issue should be recommended.  If that is not possible, a reason should be given.
- If Ben and Marshall are contact about a team member, we will try to include the team member in the process; we will coach the team member through the recovery if we can.

## Sales
### When to escalate to sales
- you find an opportunity to upsell a client
- when you find an opportunity to make a connection through a client
- when you have a valuable take-away from a client-interaction that could be marketted or sold
- when the client's expectations do not agree with the Scope of Work (if you have it)
- if you are unsure of what Radial's goals for the client engagement are
- if you feel as though the client has put you under some pressure that is contradictory to company values.

### How to escalate to sales
- send an email to Ben or Marshall (1 or the other will do)
- Identify the kind of opportunity
- If possible provide an introduction, or forward the email context.
- If there is is problem with following process, include all of management

# Changes
This policy is subject to change should we hire other sales folk, or Ben or Marshall should leave a role in management.
