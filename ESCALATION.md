# Escalation

## Customer Issues
### Intent
Within a client engagement, issues arise that may need to be addressed by someone else: the problem may be:

* technical
* related to client recovery
* related to sales or process
* an issue that a developer has with a client

It is important that the steps for communicating these details be clear and consistent to ensure that vital client communication occurs.

## Methodology
Apologize if the client is unhappy and make assurances that we will do whatever we can to resolve the issue. If it is within your power, please accommodate customer requests. It is not productive to argue with a customer as to whether they were wronged. If possible, be completely transparent. If we have erred, please get another person involved, internally. We will correct the error.  We will _not_ refund the client unless that is the only reasonable remedy.  In most cases, we will offer the client credit, work in kind, etc, in order to resolve an issue.  If we cannot immediately remedy the issue, we will tell the client the reason for any delay.

## Customer Recovery
- If clients are not satisfied process, or with products or other deliverable works, please notify  [Management](ORGANIZATION.md#management) immediately, via email and in-person, if possible.
- All relevant information should be forwarded to management.
- If possible, a resolution to the client's issue should be recommended.  If that is not possible, a reason should be given.
- If a client contacts Radial concerning a team member, we will try to include the team member in the resolution process.  If possible, we will allow team members to do the client recovery themselves, and coach them through the process.

## Team Issues
### Intent
When members of the team encounter problems that they are unable to independently solve, management is committed to helping them resolve those issues.

## Who to contact
- Issues with equipment or supplies should be emailed to [operations](ORGANIZATION.md#operations] [operatations@radialdevgroup](mailto:operatations@radialdevgroup).
- Human Resources inquiries should be made to [human-resources](ORGANIZATION.md#human-resources) [human-resources@radialdevgroup](mailto:human-resources@radialdevgroup).
- Consistent issues concerning operations, human-resources, and policy should be reported via bug for the policy document [http://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/issues].
- [Management](ORGANIZATION.md#management) will divide responsibilities in resolving these issues, delegating them as necessary.

## Process blockers and issues
- If a story is blocked, mark it as blocked in the relevant issue tracker.
- If the tracker does not support marking the issue blocked, assign it to [an engineering contact](ORGANIZATION.md#technology-and-engineering) and mention them on it.
- If [an engineering contact](ORGANIZATION.md#technology-and-engineering) is not on the project and does not have access to the issue tracker (this should literally never happen), please create an item on the Radial Sprint.ly, tag it with your project name, assign it to [an engineering contact](ORGANIZATION.md#technology-and-engineering), and mention the relevant contact on the item with the reason that you are blocked.

## Sales
### When to escalate to sales
- you find an opportunity to up-sell a client
- you find an opportunity to make a connection through a client
- you have a valuable take-away from a client interaction that could be marketed or sold
- the client's expectations do not agree with the Scope of Work (if you have it)
- you are unsure of Radial's goals for the client engagement
- you feel as though the client has put you under some pressure contradictory to company values

### How to escalate to sales
- Send an email to Lindsay [lindsay@radialdevgroup.com](mailto:lindsay@radialdevgroup.com).
- Identify the kind of opportunity.
- If possible, provide an introduction or forward the email context.
- If there is a problem with following process, include all of management.
