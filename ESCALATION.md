# Escalation

## Customer Issues
### Intent
Within a client engagement, issues arise that may need to be addressed by someone else: the problem may be technical, relate to customer recovery, be related to sales or process, or may be an issue that a developer has with a client.  It is important that the steps for communicating these details be clear and consistent to ensure that vital customer communication occurs

## Methodology
Apologize if the customer is unhappy and assure them that we will do whatever we can to resolve their issues. If it is within your power, please accommodate customer requests. It is not productive to argue with a customer as to whether they were wronged. If possible, be completely transparent. If we have erred, please get another person involved, internally. We will correct the error.  We _will_ not refund the client unless that is the only reasonable remedy.  In most cases, we will offer the client credit, work in kind, etc, in order to resolve their issue.  If we cannot immediately remedy the issue, we will tell the client the reason for any delay.

## Customer Recovery
- If a customer is not satisfied with a deliverable, product, or process, please notify  [Management](ORGANIZATION.md#management) immediately, via email and in-person, if possible.
- All relevant information should be forwarded to management
- If possible, a resolution to the customer issue should be recommended.  If that is not possible, a reason should be given.
- If Radial is contacted by a client concerning a member of the team, we will try to include the team member in the resolution process.  If possible, we will allowteam members to do the customer recovery themselves, and coach them through the process.

## Team Issues
### Intent
When member of the team encounter problems that they are unable to independently solve, management is committed to helping them resolve those issues

## Who to contact
- Issues with equipment or suppliest should be emailed to [operations](ORGANIZATION.md#operations] [operatations@radialdevgroup](mailto:operatations@radialdevgroup)
- Human Resources inquiries should be made to [human-resources](ORGANIZATION.md#human-resources) [human-resources@radialdevgroup](mailto:human-resources@radialdevgroup)
- Consistent issues concerning operations, human-resources, and policy should be reported via bug onto the policy document [http://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/issues]
- [Management](ORGANIZATION.md#management) will divide responsibilities in resolving these issues, delegating them as necessary

## Process blockers and issues
- If an story is blocked, mark it as block in the relevant issue tracker.
- If the tracker does not support marking the issue blocked, assign it to [an engineering contact](ORGANIZATION.md#technology-and-engineering) and mention them on it.
- If [an engineering contact](ORGANIZATION.md#technology-and-engineering) is not on the project and does not have access to the issue tracker (This should literally not happen), please create an item on the Radial Sprint.ly, tag it with your project name, and assign it to [an engineering contact](ORGANIZATION.md#technology-and-engineering), and mention them on the item with the reason that you are blocked.

## Sales
### When to escalate to sales
- you find an opportunity to up-sell a client
- when you find an opportunity to make a connection through a client
- when you have a valuable take-away from a client-interaction that could be marketed or sold
- when the client's expectations do not agree with the Scope of Work (if you have it)
- if you are unsure of what Radial's goals for the client engagement are
- if you feel as though the client has put you under some pressure that is contradictory to company values.

### How to escalate to sales
- send an email to [sales](ORGANIZATION.md#sales) [sales@radialdevgroup.com](mailto:sales@radialdevgroup.com)
- Identify the kind of opportunity
- If possible provide an introduction, or forward the email context.
- If there is is problem with following process, include all of management
