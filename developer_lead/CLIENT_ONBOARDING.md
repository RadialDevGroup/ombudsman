# Client Onboarding Checklist

When a contract is finalized and a dev lead is assigned, the dev lead should set up the appropriate tools and resources.

- **Create accounts as applicable:**
  - [ ] Github Repository
    - Add Client to permissions if requested
  - [ ] Pivotal Tracker project
    - Set project settings:
      - Project Start Date
      - Project Time Zone
      - Iteration Length: Typically 2 weeks
      - Point Scale: (I like Fibonacci)
      - Initial velocity: number of developers * 2 points per day * 8 days (leave some time for project management)
    - Invite Product Owner to project
  - [ ] Google group for team email
    1. Go to https://groups.google.com
    2. Click "Create Group"
    3. Use `team.{projectname}` for the "Group Email Address"
    4. Under "Basic Permissions" set the "Post" permission to "Public"
  - [ ] Slack Channels
    - #projectname-internal for developer discussions
    - #projectname for client discussion (if client wishes to communicate via Slack). Be sure to invite the client as a single channel guest.
- Email Client with information (see template below)
- Schedule [Kickoff](marketing_and_sales/KICKOFF.md)
