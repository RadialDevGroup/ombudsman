# Developer Lead Policy

## Responsibility for Process and Documentation
The developer lead is responsible for ensuring process is followed and documented. Standard project documentation is described in:
- [PROCESS](PROCESS_TEMPLATE.md)
- [README](README.md)
- [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

## Technical Decisions
1. The developer lead is responsible for making all engineering decisions on their
  designated project.
2. In the absence of the developer lead (i.e. if they are out of the office,
  unable to be reached, etc.), any engineering decisions that diverge from the
  original plan cannot be made until the developer lead has been contacted and
  approved the change.
3. If you feel that an engineering decision was made incorrectly or if you feel
  that your current story is blocked by an engineering decision, you are
  required to contact your developer lead to discuss.
4. If you are not a developer lead and would like to propose a change,
  you must present your argument to the developer lead with ample documentation
  for your conclusion. Evaluate every alternative before making a decision.
5. If the developer lead does not agree with your proposal and you feel strongly
  further engineering discussions should occur, bring this up in weekly retrospective
  or contact Management to continue the discussion.

## Responsibility for Previous Clients
When a previous Radial client re-engages with us, the individual who was the developer lead
when the project ended will be responsible for managing communication with the
previous client. If the client is not under a maintenance contract (or their
contract status is unknown), coordinate with Management on resourcing and the next
steps for the client before any additional work is performed.

If you were not the most recent developer lead and you see a new message from a previous client,
please be a pal and notify that person.
