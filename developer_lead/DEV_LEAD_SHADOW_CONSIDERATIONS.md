## Points to consider
- How does the dev lead keep track of todos on a project?
- How does the dev lead keep the team on track/feeling motivated?
- How does the dev lead deliver bad news to the client? 
- What are the benefits and drawbacks of communicating via: Slack? Tracker comments/blockers? Meetings?
- How does the dev lead support other team members?
- How does the dev lead track how the project is progressing throughout the week (different from tracking todos)? 
- If the team is not meeting sprint goals, what are some of the strategies the dev lead is using to get on track?
