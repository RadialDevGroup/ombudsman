# Developer Lead README

Welcome to the Developer Lead README. This resource should give you adequate preparation and materials to be successful as a developer lead. As with everything else, your success also depends on your team, and letting your support people (managers, technical leaders) know when you need additional support.

## Developer Lead Training
You will shadow a developer lead for two weeks to become familiar with duties and processes you will need to know to successfully manage a project.
  1. Please start by reading the [Developer Lead Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Quick-Start-Developer-Lead-Guide)
  2. Go over the list of [recurring tasks](./RECURRING_TASKS.md) developer leads are expected to complete. Be sure to discuss these quarterly responsibilities with the lead you are shadowing.  Set a personal reminder to keep your projects up to date.
  3. Get "project creator" permission in Pivotal Tracker for your project from management.
  4. Review [Dev Lead Training Thoughts](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Dev-Lead-Training-Thoughts) to ensure you cover key topics during your training.

### First Project
This is where the rubber meets the road with your training.  Be sure to leverage your Team Lead/Dev Lead mentor as you begin to talk through this new project.
- Make sure to review the [Developer Lead Guide](./DEVELOPER_LEAD_GUIDE.md) and ask any questions that arise.
- If this is a [new project](#new-projects), schedule a time to talk through your kickoff with another developer lead.
- If this is an [existing project](#developer-lead---project-transitions), make sure to take time to reflect as you begin to take on the reporting role, to ensure you ask any questions that you have.

## Developer Lead - Project Transitions
See [Project Handoff](./PROJECT_HANDOFF.md)

## Backup Dev Lead

Each developer lead should select a backup dev lead for their project. The backup dev lead's role is to step in for an unplanned absence. They should not necessarily be the person who takes over your project when you are out for a planned absence, although they can be. 

If have a plan to be out, you should find someone to take over the project and do an official handoff with them. If the acting dev lead for your planned absence will not be the backup dev lead, inform the backup dev lead so they know they do not need to take over your project while you are out.

Example 1: Natasha is the Hapyn backup dev lead, but Tim (Hapyn dev lead) is out this week for a planned vacation. Natasha is busy with other work, so Tim asks Kayla to be his acting dev lead and does a handoff with her the week prior to his vacation. He tells Natasha so she is aware Kayla will be acting dev lead while he is out.

Example 2: Tim is working this week as the Hapyn dev lead, but his daughter gets sick on Wednesday and he has to take the day off to care for them. Natasha, who is the backup dev lead, becomes dev lead for the day while Tim is out.

## New Projects

Review the [Client Onboarding Checklist](./CLIENT_ONBOARDING.md) and the [Client Onboarding Guide](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/blob/master/documents/ClientOnboardingGuide.pdf) and be sure to escalate any questions that you have.

Things to reiterate to clients as part of your initial interactions:
  - You ARE the Developer Lead and the main point of contact, but that we try to limit dedicating people to particular projects and that projects benefit from a broad range of staff.
  - The success of the project is a team effort and relies on our ability to work as a team to pair, do code reviews, create brainshare, etc. Our lifetime as a company has been invested in finding the most effective way to do these things. It's cheaper to hire a freelancer, if what you want is the success that an individual is capable of, but we believe that's a risky proposition. Most clients who have been around the block already know better.
- Things to think about
  - You are forging a new relationship, and forges mean fire. Put in the time and effort and you'll have a strong client relationship. If you don't, you'll get burned.
  - Make whatever necessary commitments to clients, but ONLY on behalf of the team.  Making personal promises to the client will burn you out and may have disciplinary repercussions.  Make sure you let your Team Lead know about these commitments so that we can do whatever is necessary to keep them.
  - You don't have to answer a question live in a meeting with a client.  You can always 'confirm with the team' before making a definitive statement.  If you're on a call with a client say only what you know. Follow up, if necessary and take good notes on what needs to be communicated.
  - People value your attention more than your knowledge or opinion.  Be sure to listen first.  Speak up when neccessary, when asked, or when your expertise needs to be heard.  Listen reflectively.
