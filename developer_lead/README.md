# Developer Lead Portal

Welcome to the Developer Lead Portal. This resource should give you adequate preparation and materials to be successful as a developer lead. As with everything else, your success also depends on your team, and letting your support people (managers, technical leaders) know when you need additional support.

## Developer Lead Training
You will shadow a developer lead for two weeks to become familiar with duties and processes you will need to know to successfully manage a project.
  1. Please start by reading the [Developer Lead Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Quick-Start-Developer-Lead-Guide)
  2. Go over the list of [recurring tasks](./RECURRING_TASKS.md) developer leads are expected to complete. Be sure to discuss these quarterly responsibilities with the lead you are shadowing.  Set a personal reminder to keep your projects up to date.
  3. Get "project creator" permission in Pivotal Tracker for your project from management.
  4. Review [Dev Lead Training Thoughts](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Dev-Lead-Training-Thoughts) for tips and best practices on how to effectively lead a project.

### First Project
This is where the rubber meets the road with your training.  Be sure to leverage your Team Lead/Dev Lead mentor as you begin to talk through this new project.
- Make sure to review the [Developer Lead Guide](./DEVELOPER_LEAD_GUIDE.md) and ask any questions that arise.
- If this is a [new project](#new-projects), schedule a time to talk through your kickoff.
- If this is an [existing project](#developer-lead---project-transitions), make sure to take time to reflect as you begin to take on the reporting role, to ensure you ask any questions that you have.

## Developer Lead - Project Transitions
Every effort should be made to transition leadership on a project (changing a client's point of contact) with no less than 2 weeks notice.  Ideal transitions are 2 weeks to 2 months.  When this becomes necessary, follow the following steps:
  1. You should work on any existing Radial project before leading it. This onboarding time should be long enough to familiarize yourself with the codebase.
  2. Receive any credentials you will need to be an effective Developer Lead on projects you are assigned to (i.e. GitHub credentials for WorkGrades, specific communication system to contact the project owner for Aleph, Apple ID credentials for Plan to Eat, Lastpass passwords, etc.)
  3. The current developer lead should advise the client of the date of the transition. If possible they should give the client a reason that their point of contact is changing.  They should send over a [professional introduction](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/How-to-make-a-professional-Introduction) and let the client know some more useful things about their new Developer Lead.  It's often helpful to provide background information, such as relevant pre-Radial experience or the projects they have successfully led at Radial.
  4. You, the new dev lead, should take over writing the reports, but the original developer lead should continue to run meetings and so-fourth until handoff.
  5. Finally, the last sprint report should identify the Monday that the new developer lead will take over.

## New Projects

Review the [Client Onboarding Checklist](./CLIENT_ONBOARDING.md) and the [Client Onboarding Guide](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/blob/master/documents/ClientOnboardingGuide.pdf) and be sure to escalate any questions that you have.

Things to reiterate to clients as part of your initial interactions:
  - You ARE the Developer Lead and the main point of contact, but that we try to limit dedicating people to particular projects and that projects benefit from a broad range of staff.
  - The success of the project is a team effort and relies on our ability to work as a team to pair, do code reviews, create brainshare, etc. Our lifetime as a company has been invested in finding the most effective way to do these things. It's cheaper to hire a freelancer, if what you want is the success that an individual is capable of, but we believe that's a risky proposition. Most clients who have been around the block already know better.
- Things to think about
  - You are forging a new relationship, and forges mean fire. Put in the time and effort and you'll have a strong client relationship. If you don't, you'll get burned.
  - Make whatever neccessary commitments to clients, but ONLY on behalf of the team.  Making personal promises to the client will burn you out and may have disciplinary repercussions.  Make sure you let your Team Lead know about these commitments so that we can do whatever is necessary to keep them.
  - You don't have to answer a question live in a meeting with a client.  You can always 'confirm with the team' before making a definitive statement.  If you're on a call with a client say only what you know. Follow up, if necessary and take good notes on what needs to be communicated.
  - People value your attention more than your knowledge or opinion.  Be sure to listen first.  Speak up when neccessary, when asked, or when your expertise needs to be heard.  Listen reflectively.
