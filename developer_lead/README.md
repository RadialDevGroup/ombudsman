# Developer Lead Portal

> Welcome to the Developer Lead Portal.  This resource should give you adequate preparation and materials to be successful as a developer lead.  As with everything else, your success also depends on your team, and letting your support people (Managers, Technical Leaders) know when you need additional support.

## Developer Lead Training
You will shadow a Developer Lead for 2 weeks to become familiar with duties and processes you will need to know to sucessfully manage a Project.
  1. You will start with the [Developer Lead Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Quick-Start-Developer-Lead-Guide)
  2. Remind the new Lead to keep projects up to date by checking on each project quarterly and to due [recurring tasks](./RECURRING_TASKS.md)
  3. Give the employee "project creator" permission in Pivotal Tracker.
  4. Review and ensure that you have covered key [Dev Lead Training Thoughts](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Dev-Lead-Training-Thoughts)

## Developer Lead - Project Transitions
  - The employee should work on any existing Radial project before leading it. This onboarding time should be long enough to familiarize them with the codebase.
  - Provide any credentials the employee will need to be an effective Developer Lead on projects they are assigned to (i.e. GitHub credentials for WorkGrades, specific communication system to contact the project owner for Aleph, Apple ID credentials for Plan to Eat, Lastpass passwords, etc.)
