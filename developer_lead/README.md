# Developer Lead Portal

> Welcome to the Developer Lead Portal.  This resource should give you adequate preparation and materials to be successful as a developer lead.  As with everything else, your success also depends on your team, and letting your support people (Managers, Technical Leaders) know when you need additional support.

## Developer Lead Training
You will shadow a Developer Lead for 2 weeks to become familiar with duties and processes you will need to know to sucessfully manage a Project.
  1. You will start with the [Developer Lead Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Quick-Start-Developer-Lead-Guide)
  2. Remind the new Lead to keep projects up to date by checking on each project quarterly and to due [recurring tasks](./RECURRING_TASKS.md)
  3. Give the employee "project creator" permission in Pivotal Tracker.
  4. Review and ensure that you have covered key [Dev Lead Training Thoughts](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Dev-Lead-Training-Thoughts)

## Developer Lead - Project Transitions
Every effort should be made to transition leadership on a project (Changing a client's point of contact) with no less than 2 weeks notice.  Ideal transitions are 2 weeks to 2 months.  When this becomes neccesary, follow the following steps:
  1. The employee should work on any existing Radial project before leading it. This onboarding time should be long enough to familiarize them with the codebase.
  2. Provide any credentials the employee will need to be an effective Developer Lead on projects they are assigned to (i.e. GitHub credentials for WorkGrades, specific communication system to contact the project owner for Aleph, Apple ID credentials for Plan to Eat, Lastpass passwords, etc.)
  3. Advise the client of the date of the transition. If possible give the client a reason that thier point of contact is changing.  Send over a [professional introduction](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/How-to-make-a-professional-Introduction) and let the client know some more useful things about their new Developer Lead.  It's often helpful to provide backtground information, such as relevant pre-Radial experience or the projects they have successfully lead at Radial.
  4. Have the new dev lead take over writing the reports, but continue to run meetings and so-fourth until handoff.
  5. Finally, the last sprint report should identify the Monday that the new dev lead will take over.
