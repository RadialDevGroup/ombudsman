# Getting Started
Read the [Quick Start Guide](SHORT_DEV_LEAD_GUIDE.md)

# Reporting Policy
My goal is to be able to keep track of high-level goals for projects and ensure that adequate and correct resourcing is available.  I also want to make sure we are functioning as a team to complete initiatives across projects.

Reports should be sent to team, unless there is a legitimate confidentiality consideration, every Friday.  Please update the white board.

Requirements:
- What is the goal this sprint?
- What did you accomplish towards your goal?
- What did you not get done?
- Will you be able to meet your goal?
- What do you need this week?
- What is the current status of your budget?

# Kickoff, Grooming, and Sprint Delivery
**Kickoff**. You are reponsible for scheduling and making preparations for a project's kickoff.  See the [Kickoff](marketing_and_sales/KICKOFF.md) document for more info.

**A sprint delivery/sprint planning meeting** should occur on either the last or first day of every sprint. This meeting should be with the client and dev lead (other developers may or may not be present). The purpose is to go over what was completed, and what will be completed during the next sprint, this is also the time to discuss any changes in priority.

**Grooming** should occur every week (or at a minimum, every 2 weeks for month-long sprints). Everyone planning to work on the project before the next grooming meeting should attend. The purpose of this meeting is to go through each story clarifying any details and assigning points if not already assigned. Grooming should, at a minimum ensure that nothing on the project has changed: meet and discuss upcoming features, even if you don't think anything has changed for all active projects.
