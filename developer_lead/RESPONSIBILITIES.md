# Getting Started
Read the [Quick Start Guide](SHORT_DEV_LEAD_GUIDE.md)

## Responsibility for Process and Documentation
The developer lead is responsible for ensuring process is followed and documented. Standard project documentation is described in:
- [PROCESS](PROCESS_TEMPLATE.md)
- [README](README.md)
- [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

There are some helpful examples of how to write a [PROCESS](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Project-PROCESS-Development/_edit), [PULL_REQUEST](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Project-PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE-Development/_edit). and [README](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Project-README-Development/_edit) in the [wiki](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki#developer-lead-support).

## Technical Decisions
1. The developer lead is responsible for making all engineering decisions on their
  designated project.
2. In the absence of the developer lead (i.e. if they are out of the office,
  unable to be reached, etc.), any engineering decisions that diverge from the
  original plan cannot be made until the developer lead has been contacted and
  approved the change.
3. If you feel that an engineering decision was made incorrectly or if you feel
  that your current story is blocked by an engineering decision, you are
  required to contact your developer lead to discuss.
4. If you are not a developer lead and would like to propose a change,
  you must present your argument to the developer lead with ample documentation
  for your conclusion. Evaluate every alternative before making a decision.
5. If the developer lead does not agree with your proposal and you feel strongly
  further engineering discussions should occur, bring this up in weekly retrospective
  or contact Management to continue the discussion.
  
## Budget Issues
1. Any budget issues shall be negotiated by someone with contract signing authority.  If you do not have the authority to write and sign a new contract, please notify a superior if there is any kind of dispute or issue about budget.
2. A developer lead should discuss budget with client in terms of hours and not dollars to avoid misunderstandings, and to avoid a situation where they might over-promise to a customer inadvertently.
3. A developer may and should recommend a budget increase to a client, but ultimately hand off final negotiation to someone with contract signing authority to make the arrangement official.
4. If it is clear that a budget needs to be decreased, or if a client requests a reduced budget, please notify someone with contract signing authority to renegotiate the terms of the change.
5. If a client requests anything that could qualify as a new project (new codebase, something exterior to the current project, etc) while they still have a significant backlog of items in the main vein of the engagement, this is an upsell opportunity and we should attempt to either sell an increase in budget (even temporarily) and potentially a distinct delivery team for it if possible.  This is a way we can potentially increase the amount we are paid by a client.  Handle this by notifying someone with contract signing authority of the opportunity and allowing them to negotiate the opportunity.  We will make an effort to land the work as a priority over making a new deal and increasing our engagement ($$$) with the customer.


## Responsibility for Previous Clients
When a previous Radial client re-engages with us, the individual who was the developer lead
when the project ended will be responsible for managing communication with the
previous client. If the client is not under a maintenance contract (or their
contract status is unknown), coordinate with Management on resourcing and the next
steps for the client before any additional work is performed.

If you were not the most recent developer lead and you see a new message from a previous client,
please be a pal and notify that person.

# Reporting Policy
Management's goal is to be able to keep track of high-level goals for projects and ensure that adequate and correct resourcing is available. They also want to make sure we are functioning as a team to complete initiatives across projects.

Reports should be sent **every Friday** to team, unless there is a legitimate confidentiality consideration.

Requirements:
- What is the goal this sprint?
- What did you accomplish towards your goal?
- What did you not get done?
- (If mid sprint) Will you be able to meet your goal?
- What do you need next week/sprint?
- What is the current status of your budget?

# Kickoff, Grooming, and Sprint Delivery
**Kickoff**. You are responsible for scheduling and making preparations for a project's kickoff.  See the [Kickoff](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Project-Kickoff) document for more info.

**A sprint delivery/sprint planning meeting** should occur on either the last or first day of every sprint. This meeting should be with the client and dev lead. It is recommended that at least one other developer be present for advice and guidance. The purpose is to go over what was completed and what will be completed during the next sprint. This is also the time to discuss any changes in priority.

**Grooming** should occur every week (or at a minimum, every 2 weeks for month-long sprints). Everyone planning to work on the project before the next grooming meeting should attend. The purpose of this meeting is to go through each story, clarifying any details and assigning points if not already assigned. Grooming should, at a minimum, ensure that nothing on the project has changed. Meet and discuss upcoming features, even if you don't think anything has changed for all active projects.
