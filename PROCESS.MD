# Working on RadialDevGroup/Policy

1. Pick a story from Policy's GitHub issues and assign it to yourself.

    > Example: #1 As a user I want a better clarification of vacation and holiday policy so that I know if I am expected to report to work July 4th.

2. Create a local branch in your development environment to work on the story.

    > Example: 1-holiday-clarification
