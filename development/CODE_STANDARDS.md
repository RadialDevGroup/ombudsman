## STANDARDS

### Style Guides
We understand that everybody has their own style when it comes to coding - but every now and then, we run into issues. Whether it's a question about consistency or simply questions about best practices, style guides give us a point of reference. As a group we've decided to adopt style guides for the various languages we use at RDG. They are found [here](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Style-Guide(s)).

### Usage
When doing PR reviews and you have a question or comment regarding a style, please reference and provide a link to the appropriate style guide. For each recommendation in the style guide, there is a link to the particular recommendation.

For example:

![styleguide_link](http://res.cloudinary.com/dskklkdv2/image/upload/v1476197150/Screen_Shot_2016-10-11_at_8_44_09_AM_vajxf0.png)

In Github:

![github_comment](http://res.cloudinary.com/dskklkdv2/image/upload/v1476197413/Screen_Shot_2016-10-11_at_8.49.49_AM_tthubf.png)

This will help us promote a consistent coding style within the team.

### Exceptions
It's important to stress the term, *guide*. In the Wiki, a couple exceptions to the recommendations are already noted, and if you have issue with the existing style guides, please feel free to update the Wiki with your recommendations for review by the team. These guides are intended to be a living document and a general framework that we can all reference in our coding.

### Projects

Please list style guide exceptions in the PROCESS.md on individual projects.

*Note: Style Guides referenced in specific projects take precedence over the default standard.*
