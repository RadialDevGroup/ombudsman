# Attendance Policy

## Intents and Values

Every opportunity must be afforded an employee to live wholeheartedly at work
and at home.  We believe that allowing employees to bring themselves to work is
the best investment we can make into our employees, before professional
development and other perks.  We believe that being employed and resourced
based on personal commitments is superior to using shame or a complex
disciplinary policy to enforce a set of rules.  As such, we ask all employees
to proactively communicate their commitment to a shedule and to any change to
that schedule, as soon as possible.  A failure to effectively communicate
schedule changes or to meet commitments may be grounds for dismissal if not
corrected.

## Schedule

All employees will need to make a calendar and share it with their
supervisor(s).  Use your published calendar to commit to your work days and
times.  Keep it up to date.  That is your schedule.


## Communication Standards

#### Tell your team.

If you will be late to or absent from your committed work schedule, please
contact:

* your supervisor

* any client or client representative that you planned to see during the period
  where you will instead be absent

* especially, your teammates or pair

#### Tell them soon.

Failure to meet commitments within one hour *without notice* is not acceptable.
Please send your notification email no later than an hour from the beginning of
you scheduled start time to let us know if you will be late or absent.

It is your responsibility to make sure we are aware if you will be unable to
work, as soon as you know and are able.

Unreported tardies and absences must be made up.

#### Communication is a priority.

Furthermore, it is preferred that you arrive 2 hours and 10 minutes late,
rather than to arrive merely 2 hours late without an email.  Please take the
time to send an email, before you leave, if you will be late more than 10 minutes.

Please do not send messages while operating a vehicle. Stop. It is more important
that you arrive, than that you arrive on time.

All tardies which occur prior to communication must be made up.

#### Keep your team in the loop.

Please notify your team of any significant changes to your calendar if and when
you make them.

## Hours and Hour Requirements

* All time will be "flex" time and scheduled according to an employee's best
  discretion.

* Please plan to work 40 Hours, and no less than 32 doing client-billable,
  community, or business development, as available.

* The remaining 8 hours may be distributed as each person sees fit and used for
  personal projects, professional development, twitter, Hardforum, etc. (e.g. 20% time)

* Please account for your 20% time, any networking events or meetups where you
  mention the company, etc, along with other reported times.

## Overtime and Comptime

You will not be expected to work more than 40 hours on any company-related task
and will not be compensated in any additional way for working overtime, except
as required by law.  If it is important to client delivery that additional time
be spent, please make sure we are aware of any overtime.  Please report any
client request for overtime, in writing, and in context.

## Vacation time

Employees will be eligible for 3 vacations annually, for up to 2 weeks each.
Please work with management to schedule them ensuring that resourcing accounts
for all client commitments.

Additional vacation may be available provided advance written perission of management.

A minimum 1 week vacation is recommended.

## Sick Time

Sick and personal time leave is available without bound.  Please take time, with
notice (see **communication standards**) as needed to ensure best-available return
to full productivity.  Please do not expose the rest of the staff to anything which
would hamper their performance or delivery.  Sick time may be taken at the employee's
discresion, subject to the intent: that the purpose of leave is to ensure return to
work and an employee may choose to work from home, if able.  Attendance to the office
during an contagious illness is discouraged, and an employee may choose to work from
home or take a sick day.

Other specific requests:
- If you have personal drama that you need to resolve, take time and resolve it, but
  ensure that it is resolved so that it will not present addditional interruption.

- If working from home will not be productive, effective, or will adversly affect
  your recovery, don't.

- Sick or personall time may be made up at managment discression, only, and only to
  ensure timely delivery for clients when originally promised

- Sick or personal time should only be mde up if specifically required to meet
  commitments to clients, and no other resourcing solution will accomplish
  delivery, and only with the permission of management.

## Work From Home

Work from home is permitted so long as it serves company and client goals for
effective and timely delivery, within the context of individual capabilities
and circumstances.

We will provide facilities, such as we are able, to allow all members of teams
to work in a common, public space.
