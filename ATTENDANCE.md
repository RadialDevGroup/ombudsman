# Attendance Policy

## Intents and Values

Every opportunity must be afforded an employee to live wholeheartedly at work
and at home.  We believe that allowing employees to bring themselves to work is
the best investment we can make into our employees, before professional
development and other perks.  We believe that being employed and resourced
based on personal commitments is superior to using shame or a complex
disciplinary policy to enforce a set of rules.  As such, we ask all employees
to proactively communicate their commitment to a shedule and to any change to
that schedule, as soon as possible.  A failure to effectively communicate
schedule changes or to meet commitments may be grounds for dismissal if not
corrected.

## Schedule

All employees will need to make a calendar and share it with their
supervisor(s).  Use your published calendar to commit to your work days and
times.  Keep it up to date.  That is your schedule.

If a regular 4-day work schedule is preferred, it may be possible to arrange that
with management permission, provided that it does not impact the team or will delay
meeting client commitments.

## Communication Standards

#### Tell your team.

If you will be late to or absent from your committed work schedule, please
contact:

* your supervisor

* any client or client representative that you planned to see during the period
  where you will instead be absent

* especially, your teammates or pair

#### Tell them soon.

Please send your notification, by email, as soon as possible, to let your team know if you
will be late or absent. Please also notify Lindsay.  You have a responsibility to
make sure we are aware if you will be unable to work, as soon as you know and are able.

Unreported tardies and absences must be made up.

#### Communication is a priority.

Furthermore, it is preferred that you arrive 2 hours and 10 minutes late,
rather than to arrive merely 2 hours late without an email.  Please take the
time to send an email, before you leave, if you will be late more than 10 minutes.

Please do not send messages while operating a vehicle. Stop. It is more important
that you arrive, than that you arrive on time.

#### Keep your team in the loop.

Please notify your team of any significant changes to your calendar if and when
you make them.

Note: We are now using teambook to track availability and resourcing.  Please
report changes to your calendar there.

## Hours and Hour Requirements

* All time will be "flex" time and scheduled according to an employee's best
  discretion. Core hours including 9:30 am standup time, must, however, be
  observed.

* Please plan to work 40 Hours, and at a minimum of 32 doing client-billable,
  community, or business development, as available.

* By Thursday morning, if you estimate that you will not be able achieve 32 billable hours
  and/or complete your assigned Sprint goals by Friday afternoon, you must present the
  problem and solution to your developer lead and Lindsay. If you fail to communicate
  the problem and solution by Thursday morning, this will a strike against you. If you
  receive three strikes, this can result in grounds for dismissal. Personal emergencies
  and unforeseen circumstances will not be considered as a strike.

* If you have reached your 32 billable hours and completed all assigned Sprint goals,
  you are responsible for connecting with all developer leads to see if you can assist the
  project.

* Any remaining time may be distributed as each person sees fit and used for
  personal projects, professional development, twitter, Hardforum, etc. (e.g. 20% time).

* Please account for your 20% time, any networking events or meetups where you
  mention the company, etc, along with other reported times.

## Overtime and Comptime

You will not be expected to work more than 40 hours on any company-related task
and will not be compensated in any additional way for working overtime, except
as required by law.  If it is important to client delivery that additional time
be spent, please make sure we are aware of any overtime.  Please report any
client request for overtime, in writing, and in context.

## Sick Time and Personal Time

Provided that long weekends are not a regular occurance, additional weekend time
should be considered personal time. Please ensure that your delivery team is aware
that you will be absent.

Sick and personal time leave is available without bound.  Please take time, with
notice (see **communication standards**), as needed, to ensure best-available return
to full productivity.  Please do not expose the rest of the staff to anything which
would hamper their performance or delivery.  Sick time may be taken at the employee's
discretion, subject to the understanding that the purpose of leave is to ensure healthy
return to work. Office attendance during a contagious illness is discouraged; an
employee may choose to work from home or take a sick day. Half-days for reasons of
illness are also discouraged.

Other specific requests:
- If you have personal drama that you need to resolve, take time and resolve it, but
  ensure that it is resolved so that it will not present addditional interruption.

- If working from home will not be productive or will adveresly affect
  your recovery, don't.

- Sick or personal time may be made up only if specifically required to meet
  commitments to clients, and no other resourcing solution will accomplish
  delivery, and only with the permission of management.

## Vacation time

Employees will be eligible for 3 vacations annually, for up to 2 weeks each.
Please work with management to schedule them ensuring that resourcing accounts
for all client commitments.

Additional vacation or extension may be available provided advance written
permission of management.

Management strongly recommends at least one vacation of at least one contiguous
week away from the office and work tasks.

Absences not related to a health issue shall be qualified as personal time and
should be taken as needed to recuperate from work-related stress and should not
be made up given prior notice.

## Work From Home

Work from home is permitted so long as it serves company and client goals for
effective and timely delivery, within the context of individual capabilities
and circumstances.

We will provide facilities, such as we are able, to allow all members of teams
to work in a common, public space.
