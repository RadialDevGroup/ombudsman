# Attendance Policy

## Intents and Values

Every opportunity must be afforded an employee to live wholeheartedly at work
and at home.  We believe that allowing employees to bring themselves to work is
the best investment we can make into our employees, before professional
development and other perks.  We believe that being employed and resourced
based on personal commitments is superior to using shame or a complex
disciplinary policy to enforce a set of rules.  As such, we ask all employees
to proactively communicate their commitment to a schedule and to any change to
that schedule, as soon as possible.  A failure to effectively communicate
schedule changes or to meet commitments may be grounds for dismissal if not
corrected.

## Schedule

Core hours are from 9:30am to 3pm M-F Please be sure to notify the team, via email,
if you are unable to be available during core hours.  Client communication should
occur between 9am and 6pm M-F only, except by absolute neccessity.

## Communication Standards

#### Tell your team.

If you will be late to or absent from your committed work schedule, please
contact:

* your supervisor

* any client or client representative that you planned to see during the period
  where you will instead be absent

* especially, your teammates or pair

Please communicate via email.

#### Tell them soon.

Please send your notification, by email, as soon as possible, to let your team know if you
will be late or absent. Please also notify Management.  You have a responsibility to
make sure we are aware if you will be unable to work, as soon as you know and are able.

Unreported tardies and absences must be made up.

#### Communication is a priority.

Furthermore, it is preferred that you arrive 2 hours and 10 minutes late,
rather than to arrive merely 2 hours late without an email.  Please take the
time to send an email, before you leave, if you will be late more than 10 minutes.

Please do not send messages while operating a vehicle. Stop. It is more important
that you arrive, than that you arrive on time.

#### Keep your team in the loop.

Please notify your team of any significant changes to your calendar if and when
you make them.

Note: We are now using [Teambook](https://radial-development-group.teambookapp.com/)
to track availability and resourcing.  Please report changes to your calendar there.

## Hours and Hour Requirements

* All time will be "flex" time and scheduled according to an employee's best
  discretion. Core hours are from 9:30am to 3pm M-F Please be sure to notify the team, via email,
if you are unable to be available during core hours.

* Please work 40 hours per week or allocate PTO to cover.

* In the event of a deadline, weekend work will only be required if you were aware of
the deadline at the begingging of the week. In practice this means that teams may
need to work outside of business hours to meet their goals.  Please avoid scenarios
where weekend work will be required, as much as possible.

## Internal Time

As a Radial team member, you may be asked to attend and participate in internal time.
This is classified as unbillable meetings and projects like all-hands meetings,
retrospectives, trainings, business development meetings, development spikes
and internal projects.

Depending on the meeting and/or project, the most common Freckle tags may be
"Admin" or "#{internal-project-name}" (see [Time Reporting](TIME_REPORTING.md) for details).
Internal time will be counted towards your 40 hour work week.

Examples of internal time meetings
* Weekly Retrospectives - An all-hands retrospective meeting is held every
  Friday at 9:30 AM. Attendance is required unless you have taken PTO. In-person
  participation is preferred, and infrequent remote attendance is acceptable.

* Trainings - Radial tries to help advance each employee's technical and
  soft skills by providing training opportunities. Effort will be spent on scheduling
  these meetings during business hours.

* Business Development - Employees may be called upon to showcase their technical
  chops in business development meetings. These meetings may be offsite or at the
  Radial offices.


## Hack Time

* Provided all project goals are met, any remaining
  time may be used for personal projects or professional development.  Staff activities such as trainings and retrospectives shall take priority over this time.  Please allow us to promote any successes relevant to building the company's reputation.

* Please account for your hack time, any networking events or meetups where you
  mention the company, etc., along with other reported times in Freckle.

## Overtime and Comptime

40 hours of work will be required.  If any time over 40 hours is work, PTO will be
accrued for that time.  If it is important to client delivery that additional time
be spent, please ensure that we are aware so that the entire team can participate.
Please report any client request for overtime, in writing, and in context, as
additional fees may apply and additional steps may need to be taken to account for
this time.

## Paid Time Off

There are two categories of paid time off (PTO).

Category One includes time taken for bereavement, family emergencies, disability, jury duty,
or time taken for your health (including mental health). Category One leave is available
without bound and does not count against PTO.

Category Two includes time taken for vacation or planned events (i.e. scheduled appointments, etc).
Employees will accrue up to 240 hours (6 weeks) "bank" of Category Two PTO per year.  Category
Two PTO may be borrowed, up to the full amount.  Accruded PTO is available on
an annual basis, only, and resets to an accrual of 0 on January 1st.

Abuse of this policy will be grounds for formal reprimand.

## Sick Time and Personal Time

Sick and personal time leave is available within your available Category One PTO.
Please take time, with notice (see **communication standards**), as needed, to
ensure best-available return to full productivity.  Please do not expose the rest
of the staff to anything which would hamper their performance or delivery.  Sick
time may be taken at the employee's discretion, subject to the understanding that
the purpose of leave is to ensure healthy return to work. Office attendance
during a contagious illness is discouraged; an employee may choose to work from
home or take a sick day. Half-days for reasons of illness are also discouraged.

Other specific requests:
- If you have personal drama that you need to resolve, take time and resolve it, but
  ensure that it is resolved so that it will not present additional interruption.

- If working from home will not be productive or will adversely affect
  your recovery, don't.

- Absences not related to a health issue should be avoided. Where possible, please
  take care of other needs and errands as flexbile time. Time that is not made up will be counted as PTO.

- Sick or personal time shall not be made up; it is the responsiblity of management
  to ensure adequate redundancy will enable client commitments to be met.

- Your sick time should be recorded in Freckle under the project "Personal/Sick Time".

## PTO time

Employees will be eligible for vacation time through their Category Two PTO,
and may take a vacation for up to 2 weeks at a time. Please work with management
to schedule them ensuring that resourcing accounts for all client commitments.

Additional vacation or extension may be available provided advance written
permission of management.

Management strongly recommends at least one vacation of at least one contiguous
week away from the office and work tasks.

Other specific requests:
- Your vacation time should be recorded in Freckle under the project "PTO" and tagged as #vacation.
- Other PTO time should be recorded in Freckle under the project "PTO" and tagged as relevant.

## Work From Home/Remote/Flex Time

Work from home, working remotely, and flex time is permitted so long as it does not interfere with project delivery or company training or retrospective.

We will provide facilities, such as we are able, to allow all members of teams
to work in a clean, safe, common, public space.

## Maternity and Paternity Leave

Radial will follow the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. For more
