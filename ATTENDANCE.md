# Attendance Policy

## Intents and Values

Every opportunity must be afforded an employee to live wholeheartedly at work
and at home.  We believe that allowing employees to bring themselves to work is
the best investment we can make into our employees, before professional
development and other perks.  We believe that being employed and resourced
based on personal commitments is superior to using shame or a complex
disciplinary policy to enforce a set of rules.  As such, we ask all employees
to proactively communicate their commitment to a schedule and to any change to
that schedule, as soon as possible.  A failure to effectively communicate
schedule changes or to meet commitments may be grounds for dismissal if not
corrected.

## Schedule

All employees will need to manage their Teambook account and keep it updated
to reflect vacation days, work from home days, modified work hours, etc.

Lindsay will collaborate with developer leads to determine staff resourcing and
will update Teambook accordingly. You are responsible for checking Teambook at
the start of each workday and work on the project you are assigned to. If a
project that you are not resourced to in Teambook requires your attention for
more than an estimated 2 hours, you are responsible for contacting your developer
lead and Lindsay to determine if project resourcing needs to be modified.

If a regular 4-day work schedule is preferred, it may be possible to arrange that
with management permission, provided that it does not impact the team or will delay
meeting client commitments.

## Communication Standards

#### Tell your team.

If you will be late to or absent from your committed work schedule, please
contact:

* your supervisor

* any client or client representative that you planned to see during the period
  where you will instead be absent

* especially, your teammates or pair

#### Tell them soon.

Please send your notification, by email, as soon as possible, to let your team know if you
will be late or absent. Please also notify Lindsay.  You have a responsibility to
make sure we are aware if you will be unable to work, as soon as you know and are able.

Unreported tardies and absences must be made up.

#### Communication is a priority.

Furthermore, it is preferred that you arrive 2 hours and 10 minutes late,
rather than to arrive merely 2 hours late without an email.  Please take the
time to send an email, before you leave, if you will be late more than 10 minutes.

Please do not send messages while operating a vehicle. Stop. It is more important
that you arrive, than that you arrive on time.

#### Keep your team in the loop.

Please notify your team of any significant changes to your calendar if and when
you make them.

Note: We are now using [Teambook](https://radial-development-group.teambookapp.com/)
to track availability and resourcing.  Please report changes to your calendar there.

## Hours and Hour Requirements

* All time will be "flex" time and scheduled according to an employee's best
  discretion. Core hours including 9:30 am standup time, must, however, be
  observed.

* Please plan to work 40 Hours, and at a minimum of 32 doing client-billable hours.

* By Thursday morning, if you estimate that you will not be able achieve 32 client-billable hours
  and/or complete your assigned Sprint goals by Friday afternoon, you must present the
  problem and solution to your developer lead and Lindsay. If you fail to communicate
  the problem and solution by Thursday morning, this will be a strike against you. If you
  receive three strikes, this can result in grounds for dismissal. Personal emergencies
  and unforeseen circumstances will not be considered as a strike.

* If you have reached your 32 client-billable hours and completed all assigned Sprint goals,
  you are responsible for connecting with each developer lead on staff and determine
  if you can assist with their project.

* Any remaining time may be distributed as each person sees fit and used for
  personal projects, professional development, twitter, Hardforum, etc. (e.g. 20% time).

* Please account for your 20% time, any networking events or meetups where you
  mention the company, etc, along with other reported times.

## Overtime and Comptime

You will not be expected to work more than 40 hours on any company-related task
and will not be compensated in any additional way for working overtime, except
as required by law.  If it is important to client delivery that additional time
be spent, please make sure we are aware of any overtime.  Please report any
client request for overtime, in writing, and in context.

## Paid Time Off

There are two categories of paid time off (PTO).

Category One includes time taken for bereavement, family emergencies, disability
and jury duty. Category One leave is available without bound.

Category Two includes time taken for sick, personal or vacation. Employees will
have a 240 hours (6 weeks) "bank" of Category Two PTO.

The requirement of 32 client-billable hours and completion of your sprint goals
are extremely important. When you take PTO, Lindsay and the developer lead on your
currently resourced project are responsible for managing resourcing to ensure that
project deliverables are met. The following are client-billable requirements when
taking PTO:

- 8 or less hours: 32 client-billable hours required
- 9 hours to 32 hours: Difference between 32 client-billable hours from the
  the total hours taken minus 8
  - Example: If you have taken 12 hours (1 1/2 days), you are required to bill 28 hours.
    `32 - (12-8) = 28`

Policy states that 20% time is only available after you have met your 32
client-billable hours and sprint goals. Therefore, when taking PTO, please be
aware that your available 20% may be negatively affected by PTO time.
- Example: If you have taken 16 hours (2 days) PTO in a work week, then you are
  required to work 24 hours (3 days) and are not eligible for 20% time that week.

The 240 hours (6 weeks) of Category Two PTO will reset at the beginning of each year.

For new hires, the following is the available Category Two PTO for the first
year of employment:
- Q1: 240 hours
- Q2: 180 hours
- Q3: 120 hours
- Q4: 60 hours

## Sick Time and Personal Time

Provided that long weekends are not a regular occurrence, additional weekend time
should be considered personal time. Please ensure that your delivery team is aware
that you will be absent.

Sick and personal time leave is available within your available Category Two PTO.
Please take time, with notice (see **communication standards**), as needed, to
ensure best-available return to full productivity.  Please do not expose the rest
of the staff to anything which would hamper their performance or delivery.  Sick
time may be taken at the employee's discretion, subject to the understanding that
the purpose of leave is to ensure healthy return to work. Office attendance
during a contagious illness is discouraged; an employee may choose to work from
home or take a sick day. Half-days for reasons of illness are also discouraged.

Other specific requests:
- If you have personal drama that you need to resolve, take time and resolve it, but
  ensure that it is resolved so that it will not present additional interruption.

- If working from home will not be productive or will adversely affect
  your recovery, don't.

- Absences not related to a health issue shall be qualified as personal time and
  should be taken as needed to recuperate from work-related stress.

- Sick or personal time may be made up only if specifically required to meet
  commitments to clients, and no other resourcing solution will accomplish
  delivery, and only with the permission of management.

- Your sick time should be recorded in Freckle under the project "Out-of-office"
  and tagged with "#sick-time".

- Your personal time should be recorded in Freckle under the project "Out-of-office"
  and tagged with "#personal-time".

## Vacation time

Employees will be eligible for vacation time through their Category Two PTO,
and may take a vacation for up to 2 weeks at a time. Please work with management
to schedule them ensuring that resourcing accounts for all client commitments.

Additional vacation or extension may be available provided advance written
permission of management.

Management strongly recommends at least one vacation of at least one contiguous
week away from the office and work tasks.

Other specific requests:
- Your vacation time should be recorded in Freckle under the project
  "Out-of-office" and tagged with "#vacation-time".

## Work From Home

Work from home is permitted so long as it serves company and client goals for
effective and timely delivery, within the context of individual capabilities
and circumstances.

We will provide facilities, such as we are able, to allow all members of teams
to work in a common, public space.

## Maternity and Paternity Leave

Radial will follow the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. For more
information about the FMLA, please use [this](https://www.dol.gov/WHD/fmla/index.htm)
