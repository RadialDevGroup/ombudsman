# Peer Review
## Intents and Values
The purpose of peer review is to produce consistent quality product by requiring accountability, communication, and training.

In order to ensure that we can deliver on our commitments, all deliverables must be reviewed by members of the team and, if possible, the sales lead/dev lead on the project.  As peer review is often blocking it is a high priority and must be done as soon as possible.  The more eyes on a product the more likely problems will be caught early.  Review also provides an opportunity to teach or to learn and a way for all team members to be aware of changes as they happen.  

### General Process
The process for all projects should use this project as a template of good process.

Good process should meet the following criteria:

- An established way of identifying and documenting specifications and defects.  (This project uses GitHub issues; some projects use Pivotal, Sprint.ly, Asana, or Trello.)
- An established way to separate proposed changes from accepted changes.  (Most projects can use branches in git.)
- An established flow of review.  (This and other projects use email/GitHub PR Comments.)
- A way of notifying potential reviewers (such as @ mentions or email).
- A Post-acceptance response activity: most processes specify that the originator ask a reviewer to complete integrating the change.

### Process Improvement
If accepted process is not followed, or is not adequate, every member of the team is asked to proactively solve this problem.

1. Identify what activity seems to violate process.
2. Identify the accepted process or describe a process that addresses the process problem.
3. Add a description of the activity and the proposed change to process as an issue on GitHub.
4. Add a process change as a PR following [PROCESS.md](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Project-PROCESS-Development/_edit).


## Project Management
Every project must have either a Technical Sales Lead or a Dedicated Project Developer Lead.

This person will act as the account manager for the project and will review and approve project deliverables.  If the developer lead will be unavailable then an acting lead should be appointed.  In the event that a designated/acting lead is not immediately available the senior-most developer should approve the merge.
