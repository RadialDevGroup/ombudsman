## Hack time

Hack time is extra time in the week that can be used to further your career. It can look different for everyone, but it may include attending meetups, working on a side project, doing tutorials, or reading.

Here at Radial we believe in continual learning and that we all can benefit from the shared experience and learning of the team. To that end we ask that you share how you spend your hack time with your manager so your hack time can help benefit everyone. Your manager can also offer feedback and ideas to help guide your learning or project selection. Together you can set end goals and targets for your hack time and have a helping hand in making sure it gets done, if you would like that kind of support.

At each staff meeting one or two people will be asked to share what they have been doing for their hack time. This will occur on a rotation. All that is expected is for team members to briefly describe their work, but you can always share more if you want to. This gives the team an opportunity to learn from your experiences, ask questions, and get inspiration for their own hack time.
