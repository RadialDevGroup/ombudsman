## Hack time

Hack time is extra time in the week that can be used to further your career. It can look different for everyone, but it may include attending meetups, working on a side project, doing tutorials, or reading.

We are committed to helping you reach your professional goals. Please allow us to provide mentorship through this process by sharing your hack time goals with us. When you decide on a hack time goal and what success looks like (or if you need help), please discuss it with your manager. They will provide guidance and feedback to help ensure the most effective use of your time. We would also like to help you use your hack time in a focused way. For example, if your goal is to become an elite front-end developer, anticipate that we will have questions if you say your next priority is to learn Kubernetes.

At each staff meeting, we will have one or two people share what they did with their hack time. This will occur on a rotation. All that is expected is for team members to briefly describe their work, but you can always share more if you want to.
