## Hack time

Hack time is extra time in the week that can be used to further your career. It can look different for everyone but may include the following: attending meetups, working on a side project, doing tutorials, reading.

We are committed to helping you reach your career goals. For this reason we want to help you use your hack Time wisely.

**Write down what you are going to do, with success conditions.** Share this with your manager. Nobody can ever say no to what you want to do, but we want to **have a conversation** to help make sure you're going the direction that you want. For example, if you have said that you want to be the best front-end developer ever, but in your hack time you plan to learn Kubernetes, the conversation will be around why you want to learn something that doesn't help you reach your long-term career goal.

At each staff meeting, we will have one or two people **share what they did** with their hack time.
