# Hardware Process

As a matter of general service offerings, Radial Development does not offer
hardware repair to customers.
If possible, please refer to [Rob Protzman <rob@charteredtech.com >](mailto:rob@charteredtech.com), [Michael Vogt <michaelvogt52@gmail.com >](mailto:michaelvogt52@gmail.com), [Millennium Group](Screen Shot 2017-11-15 at 1.28.37 PM alias), or another (insured and qualified) IT or computer support technician.
On the rare occasion that we make an exception, we should have a process for how it will be done.

We recommend that customers maintain a support contract on their equipment to
prevent loss, via Dell Onsite, Applecare, HP 24-hour, GeekSquad, etc.

Given that any hardware work will follow these guidelines:

1. Ensure that we are insured in the event of damage at fault.

1. Verify the functional state of machine prior to start of work:
    - Verify Screen Functionality
    - Verify Computer Boot
    - Run Video Benchmark (note any anomalies)
    - Run DXDiag (note any failures)
    - Test Sound, Network Connectivity

1. Confirm work to be done with client.

1. Verify the integrity of replacement parts if available or applicable.

1. Perform service.

1. Verify that the system works with parity to original state of machine.

1. Verify repairs are completed successfully.

1. Document at every step.

At Radial Development, we stand behind the expertise of our staff, but not the
quality and workmanship of other companies' equipment (e.g. Dell, HP, Lenovo).
