# Blogging policy

## Timing
1. The Radial blog should be posted to twice monthly, or as time/strategy allows. Developers/employees will be assigned responsibility for a blog on a rotating schedule. Responsibility does not mean you have to write the blog, it just means you have to make sure someone writes it and posts it.
2. We aim to work one week ahead, so a blog running on Thursday of the week of 8/21/2017 should be completed at the latest by Friday 8/18/2017.
3. In practice this means you should write your blog on Monday or Tuesday the week before it will post.

## Writing
1. If you need sample ideas of what a good blog looks like, check out the following:
  - [How Developers Can Practice Good Design](http://radialdevgroup.com/blog/good-design-for-developers/) (Semi-technical)
  - [Why You Should Hire A Junior Developer To Bootstrap Your Startup](http://radialdevgroup.com/blog/hire-junior-developer-bootstrap-startup/) (Thought piece)
  - [Getting Started Testing With Mocha](http://radialdevgroup.com/blog/getting-started-testing-mocha/) (Technical)
2. Clarify the blog topic with the blog editor sometime before you sit down to write it. 
1. Please write your blog in Google Docs or place it into Google Docs after writing it for editing purposes. Exception: if your blog is mostly code, you can write it in an editor or Markdown or a Gist, whichever you prefer. Go to Radial>Blog Posts and create a new Google Doc.
1. Aim for a length of between 400 and 800 words. Exceptions can be made if there are significant code blocks or the like. But from a pure reading perspective, more than 800 words is most likely too long.
1. Please turn off smart quotes in Google Docs in order to avoid odd formatting issues when pasting from Docs into Wordpress. [https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/smart-quotes-google-docs] for how to turn off smart quotes.
1. Please use headings in your blog. Divide the content into sections based on the headings. Typically three sections is good.
1. After your post is completed, link to it in #content-development in Slack and @mention the blog editor to ask for edits.
5. After you get edits in Google Docs, either you or the blog editor should place the blog into the CMS. Check in to see who will do this task.
6. Blogs should be set to post Thursday morning at 1 a.m.

## Content
1. A list of possible blog topics is on the [Asana board](https://app.asana.com/0/34623129993106/list)
3. Please add blog topic ideas to the list any time you think of one.
4. Blogs should be a mix of technical and non-technical posts. Choose your topic with an eye to what has been recently posted and try to balance technical posts with non-technical ones.
5. Blogs with subheadings are better than blogs without subheadings.
6. Blogs with short sentences are better than blogs with long sentences. Try to follow some of the readability tips from Yost in the CMS.
7. Blogs with external links are better than blogs without external links. So try to link out if you can. External links should be set to open in new tabs. For example, if you are writing about React, link to the React docs. If you mention a Ruby gem, link to it. You get the idea. Reason: Links out to well-ranked pages are good for SEO. 
1. Blogs with internal links are also good. Definitely link to case studies or past blog posts that are relevant to what you are currently writing about.
8. Blogs with images are better than blogs without images. Screenshots are also good. You can annotate screenshots using [Skitch](https://evernote.com/products/skitch). If a screenshot doesn't work, you can grab an appropriate image from such free-for-commercial-use sites as:
- [Pixabay (stock photos)](https://pixabay.com/)
- [Pexels (stock photos)](https://www.pexels.com/)
- [Unsplash (stock photos)](https://unsplash.com/)
- [Government images](https://search.usa.gov/search/images)
9. All blogs need a featured image. This is the image that displays on the main blog page as the image representing the blog. Make sure that is added to the blog before it is posted.

## Before you post
- [ ] Did you add a featured image? Is this image horizontal?
- [ ] Did you add tags?
- [ ] Do your links open in a new tab?
- [ ] Does your post have a picture?
- [ ] Are there subheadings?
- [ ] Did you set the author to the correct author?
- [ ] Did you double check your posting date?

## Promotion
1. Once a blog has a permalink, an employee with access to the Radial Twitter account on Tweetdeck should schedule the blog to be tweeted out, once on the day it runs, and once on the following day.
(In practice this means Slack the permalink to Ben or Stephanie and they will schedule the Tweets)
2. If you have a Twitter account, we encourage retweeting your own blog posts or those of other Radial employees.
