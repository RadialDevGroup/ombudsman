# Time reporting

As Radial typically contracts on a time and materials basis, accurate time tracking is important to upholding accountability and improving project planning.  This document defines how time should be tracked and what is billable or unbillable.

### When to clock in and out

Clock in as soon as you reach the office and immediately before leaving for the day.  Treat any time you work from home the same way.  In general you should leave the clock running for short breaks (bio breaks, coffee breaks, etc.) of approximately 15 minutes or less.  When leaving the office (e.g. for lunch) you should generally clock out as well excepting working lunches such as sales meetings with potential clients where business is the main thing discussed.  While taking care of personal work is certainly acceptable at the office, it is expected that this will also be done off the clock.

### Billable vs. unbillable time

Billable time is any time working on a single client project.  This includes any meetings or preparation work. Record all time on the project regardless of your perceived productivity.  In your descriptions include the Pivotal Tracker story number when possible (except for PR reviews and meetings).  These numbers are used in reports sent to clients.  If you have any doubts about whether a block of time should be billable, discuss it with the project lead.

Unbillable time may be in one of several categories and is to be recorded the same way as billable.  The categories are:

 - **Admin**: Anything relating to the management of the company (Unless you are management, you will probably not use this).
 - **Management Feedback**: Anything relating to feedback for the company (e.g. retrospective, one-on-ones, action items).
 - **Sales & Business Networking**: Anything relating to sales or recruiting.
 - **Marketing**: Campaigns, research, and outreach (events, guests, and free code reviews)
 - **Hack Time**: Time spent on personal projects or continuing education.
 - **Technical Writing/Blogging**: Time spent writing or editing white papers, case-studies, or blogs
 - **[specific company initiatives]**: from time to time unbillable job codes may be assigned to specific internal projects.

### Statuses
These are not required or enforced, but are recommended.

We use Slack statuses to communicate with others in and out of the office whether or not we are avaialable.
The emojis are extremely important, as that allows others to quickly see whether you are available.

Please use the following statuses and update them throughout the day (the wording here may not be exact, but the gist is the same)

When interruptible:

:office: I'm working at the office

:house_with_garden: I'm working remotely

:no_entry_sign: I'm blocked

:dancing_pickachu: I can help others (I'm available to answer questions because I'm taking a short break at the keyboard.)

When unavailable:

:zzz: I'm AFK. I'll be back around __ (I'm Away From the Keyboard)

:headphones: I'm heads-down in some code./I'm in a meeting.


**Clear** your status at the end of the day. No status means you are gone for the day or have not come in yet.
