# Performance
## Intents

Whereas many organizations, especially prospective clients, may judge performance on the basis of completion or on the basis of estimates versus actual work, my experience suggests that this only accommodates those who would knowingly game the system. Therefore, we are resolved not to tie performance evaluations to quantitative measures of performance but wish to herein elucidate the behaviors which we wish to encourage and which will be used to define success or failure within our organizations

## Application

Before a 1-on-1, you should self-evaluate yourself based on these expectations.  You will be evaluated by the supervisor as well and any trouble areas will be discussed.  All criteria should be evaluated on a strict yes/no basis.  You should attempt to make an action plan to address trouble areas prior to the 1-on-1.  If you are unable to, you should make a plan with the assistance of the supervisor.  You will also need to, with the assistance of the supervisor if necessary, make a plan to address relevant trouble areas.  A plan should define a threshold for success.

## Deliniation of Expectations

*All expectations have been written in terms of the relevant value*

### Accountability

- All stories should take a day or less
  - Any story projected to take more that the rest of the day should be broken up
  - Any story that takes more than a day and cannot be broken up warrants a significant discussion
- Not all developers can solve all of the problems
  - Know your limits. Own them
  - Know the difference between wasting time and being diligent.
- When you fail, project that you will fail, or don't succeed quickly, get help

### Wholeness

- Spend some time every week/month to write code for you.
  - If you don't feel like writing code for yourself, please plan a vacation
  - Work on a side-project
  - Do something frivolous,
  - Plan a company hack day
  - Plan or attend a hack-a-thon
  - Find a creative outlet for your skills
- Manage your stress

  *There is very little management can do to support you here.  This is something you are responsible to manage*

  Sometimes, you really can't handle all of the responsibility that you are given.  Please communicate about this. It may be possible for you to delegate some of it, or to be assigned a reduction in responsibility.  As with other aspects of operations, the key is communications.

- We need to be aware of and correct issues in your work environment that impact performance and personal care:
  - We will do what we can to accommodate needs related to focus, introversion, distraction, and collaboration, etc.
  - Don't assume that because the way we have done things does not accommodate you that we are unwilling to be accommodating.
  - If your needs are not being addressed, please ensure that we are aware, and that there is a reason your needs have not been addressed.

### Care

- If you are billing time to a client and not completing work, the answer is not to stop billing or to ignore the problem
- If you have a regular pattern that significant work needs to be done to make PR's ready to merge after review, work to retrospect and resolve this so that better expectations are documented and that you do adequate pre-review before requesting review by a peer.
- If you take a story on, you should evaluate completion via manual testing, in addition to automated testing.
  - Ensure that it completes the work.
  - Ensure that the feature does not negatively impact performance or user experience in an obvious way.
  - Ensure that the addition of the feature does not result in the application interface becoming unpredictable or unreliable in some way
- Don't do extra work
- Provide a useful interface for successful reuse of your work
- Evaluate future usage of data structures and ensure that future relationships can be made deterministic
- Focus on results first, when test-driving development
- Your work should be fully functioning and not stubbed out.
  - If the button is present, it should work
  - If an action is present, it should complete
  - If an endpoint is present, it should be fully tested for at least one usage example
- Listen completely and make others feel heard and validated before addressing concerns

### Collaboration

- Look for opportunities to work with others and leverage their expertise
- Reference the work of leading developers in the community often.  Consider that the approach they use may not be optimal for all situations, but that by following industry guidance, your results and implementation will be conventional and understandable.  If you've made a controversial decision, being able to identify the points in the industry debate is an important trait.
- Use other people's code.  Give credit where credit is due.
- Your contributions to another member of the team are more valuable to the overall operation than your personal performance or execution.  This applies to moral and emotional support, not just technical expertise.
  Consider a braided rope: given a load that can be held by the 3 strands, if one breaks, the 2 remaining strands will be unable to bear the load, but if the strands are braided, they distribute the load better over the length of the rope, ensuring that the weakest points in each strand are supported -- the strand will be unlikely to break.
- Find common ground.  Use it as a foundation for resolving conflicts
- Talk about both sides of a technical debate.  Learn to understand both sides.

### Courage

- Be willing to make mistakes
- Be willing to waste some time
- Make a decision.  If necessary, make a bad one.
- Admit that you don't know, that you don't have a clue
- Consider alternate points of view
- Pick up a phone and make a call
- Be a bother
- Break the rules; or don't -- whichever is the hard thing.
- Engage conflict.
