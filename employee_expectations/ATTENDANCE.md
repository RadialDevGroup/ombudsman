## Intents and Values

Every opportunity must be afforded an employee to live wholeheartedly at work
and at home. We believe that allowing employees to bring themselves to work is
the best investment we can make into our employees, before professional
development and other perks. We believe that being employed and resourced
based on personal commitments is superior to using shame or a complex
disciplinary policy to enforce a set of rules. As such, we ask all employees
to proactively communicate their commitment to a schedule and to any change to
that schedule, as soon as possible. A failure to effectively communicate
schedule changes or to meet commitments may be grounds for dismissal if not
corrected.

#### Background

Historically, the requirement had been 32 hours of billable work were required.  We discovered, however that this did not give us adequate time to take care of some of the business activities essential to our operation, limited feedback and made it difficult to delegate staff-completable work.  We also discovered that actually reliably working the 32 hours was also inconsistent.  When in 2017, we changed the requirement to 40 hours, we found that we were much more reliable in completing goals for clients, accounting for sick time and vacation, and more flexible in what we could resource and plan for.

In 2020, we are revising this policy again because some of the benefits and limits did not align with our goals.  The 40 hour requirement can now be made more flexible to account for the ebb and flow of daily life.  We will not be taking a strict view of this requirement UNLESS it causes a secondary problem or is determined to be a chronic non-compliance issue.

## Communication Standards

### Tell your team.

If you will be late to or absent from your committed work schedule, please contact:

* your supervisor

* any client or client representative that you planned to see during the period
  where you will instead be absent

* especially, your teammates or pair

Please communicate via email.

### Tell them soon.

Please send your notification, by email, as soon as possible, to let your team know if you
will be late or absent. Please also notify Management. You have a responsibility to
make sure we are aware if you will be unable to work, as soon as you know and are able.

Unreported tardies and absences must be made up.

### Communication is a priority.

Furthermore, it is preferred that you arrive 2 hours and 10 minutes late,
rather than to arrive merely 2 hours late without an email. Please take the
time to send an email, before you leave, if you will be late more than 10 minutes.

Please do not send messages while operating a vehicle. Stop. It is more important
that you arrive, than that you arrive on time.

### Keep your team in the loop. (How to request time off)

When requesting vacation days, email your request to the Director of Engineering and cc your Team Lead.
Once your request has been approved put your days off on your google calendar as an Out of Office event.
Please also put major appointments as OOO so your team knows that you will not be available.
Email [team](mailto:team@radialdevgroup.com) to notify them of the days you will be out.
Please update your team if there are any significant changes to your calendar.

## Compensation

### Pay Dates

Employees will be paid twenty-four times per year, on the 1st and 16th of the month. If that day is a weekend or holiday, they will be paid on the preceding business day.

### Salaried Employees

Salaried employees will be paid $65,520/year.

### Hourly Employees

Hourly employees will be paid $31.50/hour. The pay period ends five (5) business days before the pay date.

## Availability

Adding absences to your work calendar is necessary so that your planned time off can be accounted for during resource planning.
Client communication should occur between 9am and 6pm M-F only, except by absolute necessity.

### Work From Home/Remote/Flex Time

Work from home, working remotely, and flex time is permitted so long as it does not interfere with project delivery or company training or retrospective.

We will provide facilities, such as we are able, to allow all members of teams
to work in a clean, safe, common, public space.

### Salaried Employees

Salaried staff should plan to be available between 10:00am and 3:00pm on days when they are working. Please be sure to notify the team via email if you are unable to be available during core hours.

### Hourly Employees

Hourly employees may set their availability as needed. It is greatly appreciated if changes to availability are made prior to the Wednesday before the sprint starts and communicated to their manager.

## Furloughs, Hours reduction, etc

### Hourly Employees

Hourly employees may be requested to take a reduction in hours. If so, individuals will be assisted in applying for temporary unemployment benefits upon request.

## PTO

Three weeks notice is required for PTO requests. We understand that some things come up last minute (see [Sick Time and Self Care](#sick-time-and-self-care) below), and we will try to honor those urgent requests as much as is possible and reasonable. Non-urgent requests with less than three weeks notice will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Salaried Employees

PTO Hours will be accrued at a rate of 11.67 Hours per pay period with a maximum of 280 per year.

### Hourly Employees (at 31.50 rate, only)

PTO hours will be accrued at a rate of .268 hours per hour worked.

**Philosophy**:
- In order for part-time or hourly staff to be paid equitably their accrual needs to include the 2 weeks of December closure and 2 weeks of holidays which can be taken as floating holidays or on the date.
- The expectation is that hourly employees will not be compensated for professional development time, but are estimated to spend 3 hours weekly on average for Retrospectives, 1:1's, and other administrative concerns, totaling 35-hours per week maximum.
- The total accrual is 384.58 hours of PTO

### Holidays

Radial will be closed on the following days and employees are expected to not work.
- Employee Appreciation Day (first Friday in March)
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Thanksgiving Day & the Friday after Thanksgiving
- "Voting Day" (the Monday 8 days before the November Election Day for municipal, county and state elections). **Because Colorado generally votes early by mail, we take the time to research and fill out our ballots on a less-disruptive day.**
- Annual Winter closure (two weeks) as announced

### Sick Time and Self Care

Life is bumpy, but we are happy to accommodate those bumps (doctor's appointments, renewing your driver's license, participating in a citizenship activity, etc). If you are struggling with a personal issue, you may take the time you need to get better. Having notified your team, you may take up to a day off of work for any sort of self-care reason, without prior permission. If you are sick, stay home. Don't give us your germs. Please use PTO for this time.

If you believe that this will limit your ability to take vacation as otherwise scheduled or planned, please request an exception. Exceptions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may be excused as 'Personal time' by management.

If you do miss time, you have the option to make that up within the sprint. However, this should be discussed with your Team Lead. Team Leads may direct employees to clock time as PTO or mandate how and when it is to be made up. As with other attendance concerns, this timeline is subject to exception, on a case-by-case basis.

## Hack Time

### Explanation

* Provided all project goals are (or will be) met, any remaining time may be used for personal projects or professional development.  Staff activities such as trainings and retrospectives shall take priority over this time. Please allow us to promote any successes relevant to building the company's reputation.

* Please account for your hack time, any networking events or meetups where you
  mention the company, etc., along with other reported times in Noko.

* If you are not sure how to bill your time please see [this wiki](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Common-Time-Reporting-Codes-%28Noko%29).

### Salaried Employees

Salaried staff may take/use hack time per the explanation above.

### Hourly Employees

Hourly employees may bill hack time with approval from their manager

## Hour Requirements, Overtime, and Comp Time

### Salaried Employees

40 hours of work per week will be required. If it is important to client delivery that additional time be spent, please ensure that we are aware so that the entire team can participate. Please report any client request for overtime, in writing, and in context, as additional fees may apply and additional steps may need to be taken to account for
this time. No comp time or overtime will be applied except as required by law.

If full-time employees regularly fail to meet the expectation that they report roughly 40 hours per week of work, this will result in a conversation with management. Initially, we will identify if the organization or team needs to make adjustments to facilitate better compliance; if that is ineffective, we will identify steps that an employee should take to bring time-keeping into compliance, and if issues persist, this will become grounds for disciplinary action.

In the event that an employee is given business-mandated weekend work, the employee will be given a $45 bonus per instance. This includes working any Saturday or Sunday, working during a scheduled company closure, or any necessary work done after 6 pm.  This time must be identified and approved by Ben.

## Leave

The three-week notice requirements apply to unpaid leave (except FMLA), to the extent possible. We understand that there are sometimes emergency circumstances which make this type of notice challenging, and management will do its best to approve leave in these circumstances as well.

Unpaid leave is available in increments of less than or equal to 6 weeks at a time.

All unpaid leave must be taken for a reason. The reason can be any reason, but there needs to be one and the employee will submit it to management.

At the beginning of any consecutive unpaid leave period, management reserves the right to determine whether this leave constitutes job abandonment.

### Parental Leave

Radial will follow the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993](https://www.dol.gov/WHD/fmla/index.htm). In addition to FMLA, the leave policy explained in the previous section is still applicable.

At this time Radial does not offer paid parental leave. However, you can sign up for Short Term Disability through Aflac*. If you anticipate needing more paid time off for the birth or adoption of a child, we suggest you plan to use your Paid Time Off. If you need to borrow vacation time from the next year, please speak with management as that may be an option.

We realize everyone has different needs when they return to work after the arrival of a child. Management will work with you to create a plan and make any accommodations necessary, including returning part-time and working back up to full-time if that is desired.

*Open Enrollment for Aflac is in December each year, with new plans starting Jan 1.

*At the time of this writing, Aflac's Short Term Disability policy offers the following for Maternity Leave:
> You must have the policy in place 10 full months before delivery
>
> Normal delivery is 6 weeks of paid leave less the waiting period of 7 or 14 days which ever the employee has chosen
>
> C-Section is 8 weeks of paid leave less the waiting period of 7 or 14 days which ever the employee has chosen
