# Attendance Policy

## Intents and Values

Every opportunity must be afforded an employee to live wholeheartedly at work
and at home. We believe that allowing employees to bring themselves to work is
the best investment we can make into our employees, before professional
development and other perks. We believe that being employed and resourced
based on personal commitments is superior to using shame or a complex
disciplinary policy to enforce a set of rules. As such, we ask all employees
to proactively communicate their commitment to a schedule and to any change to
that schedule, as soon as possible. A failure to effectively communicate
schedule changes or to meet commitments may be grounds for dismissal if not
corrected.

## Schedule

Core hours are from 10am to 3pm M-F. Please be sure to notify the team via email if you are unable to be available during core hours.
Adding absences to your work calendar is necessary so that your planned time off can be accounted for during resource planning.
Client communication should occur between 9am and 6pm M-F only, except by absolute necessity.

## Communication Standards

### Tell your team.

If you will be late to or absent from your committed work schedule, please
contact:

* your supervisor

* any client or client representative that you planned to see during the period
  where you will instead be absent

* especially, your teammates or pair

Please communicate via email.

### Tell them soon.

Please send your notification, by email, as soon as possible, to let your team know if you
will be late or absent. Please also notify Management. You have a responsibility to
make sure we are aware if you will be unable to work, as soon as you know and are able.

Unreported tardies and absences must be made up.

### Communication is a priority.

Furthermore, it is preferred that you arrive 2 hours and 10 minutes late,
rather than to arrive merely 2 hours late without an email. Please take the
time to send an email, before you leave, if you will be late more than 10 minutes.

Please do not send messages while operating a vehicle. Stop. It is more important
that you arrive, than that you arrive on time.

### Keep your team in the loop.

Please put your days off and major appointments on your google calendar as OOO.
Email [team](mailto:team@radialdevgroup.com) to notify them of the days you will be out.
Please update your team if there are any significant changes to your calendar.

## Hourly Employees
### Compensation
Hourly employees receive 20% more compensation per hour than salaried employees since they do not accrue vacation time and are disproportionately harmed by closures.

### Availability
Hourly employees may set their availability as needed. Changes to availability should be made with 2 weeks notice, where possible, but can be modified at any time with management.

### Hours reduction
Hourly employees requested to take a reduction in hours will be assisted in applying for temporary unemployment benefits, if requested.

## Salaried Employees
### Hours and Hour Requirements

Any time not accounted for which does not add up to weekly hour requirements will be deducted from your PTO total. Any additional time worked will be credited as compensation time and added to your PTO total.

In practice this means you are able to "flex" your hour requirements from week to week.

* Core hours are from 10:00am to 3pm M-F Please be sure to notify the team, via email,
if you are unable to be available during core hours.

* Please work 40 hours per week or allocate PTO to cover.

### Internal Time

As a Radial team member, you may be asked to attend and participate in internal time.
This is classified as unbillable meetings and projects like all-hands meetings,
retrospectives, trainings, business development meetings, development spikes
and internal projects.

Depending on the meeting and/or project, the most common Freckle tags may be
"Admin" or "#{internal-project-name}" (see [Time Reporting](TIME_REPORTING.md) for details).
Internal time will be counted towards your 40 hour work week.

Examples of internal time meetings
* Weekly Retrospectives - An all-hands retrospective meeting is held every
  Friday at 9:00 AM. Attendance is required unless you have taken PTO. In-person
  participation is preferred, and infrequent remote attendance is acceptable.

* Trainings - Radial tries to help advance each employee's technical and
  soft skills by providing training opportunities. Effort will be spent on scheduling
  these meetings during business hours.

* Business Development - Employees may be called upon to showcase their technical
  chops in business development meetings. These meetings may be offsite or at the
  Radial offices.

### Hack Time

* Provided all project goals are met, any remaining
  time may be used for personal projects or professional development.  Staff activities such as trainings and retrospectives shall take priority over this time. Please allow us to promote any successes relevant to building the company's reputation.

* Please account for your hack time, any networking events or meetups where you
  mention the company, etc., along with other reported times in Freckle.

### Overtime and Comptime

40 hours of work will be required, and any additional time worked will be
accrued as PTO. If it is important to client delivery that additional time
be spent, please ensure that we are aware so that the entire team can participate.
Please report any client request for overtime, in writing, and in context, as
additional fees may apply and additional steps may need to be taken to account for
this time. In the event that an employee is given business-mandated weekend work,
the employee will be given a $45 bonus per instance. This includes working any
Saturday or Sunday, working during a scheduled company closure, or any necessary
work done after 6 pm.

### Sick Time and Self Care

Life is bumpy. We are happy to accommodate the bumpiness of life. These generally could include items such as being out of the office for a few hours for a doctor's appointment, renewing your driver's license, participating in a citizenship activity, et cetera.

You may take up to a day for any sort of self care reason. If you need to take more than a day, it should be considered PTO.

These accommodations will generally be referred to as sick time or self care time. You are not required to take PTO for this time.

The funding for this comes out of company profit, and is not accounted for as compensation.

However, if you are sick or struggling in some other way, you may, having given notice to your team, take the time you need to take to be better.

If this is for more than one day, this is probably not sick/self care time, and should be taken as vacation or unpaid leave.

You must identify in your timesheet how much leave, vacation, sick time, or self care time you are taking, and the reason.

### Paid Time Off

Paid Time Off is six weeks or 240 hours annually, accrued on an hourly basis. It resets every year and up to 50 percent can be borrowed in advance (e.g. on Jan 1 you can borrow up to 3 weeks of PTO).

PTO requests where you will be out of office for two weeks or fewer will generally be approved by default. However, you should always notify management by email at least three weeks prior to taking the time off. In addition, add an "OOO" event to your calendar for your days off so it can be accounted for during resource planning. If management plans to deny PTO, they must give you two weeks notice. Do not forget to add the time to Noko at the start of your absence.

PTO requests with a length of greater than two weeks (10 business days) will not be approved by default, but can be approved after discussion with management. The best way to get this type of request approved would be to give more advance notice.

Upon separation, the employee will receive compensation in the amount of unused accrued PTO.

 Your vacation time should be recorded in Noko under the project "PTO" and tagged as #vacation.
- Other non-vacation PTO time should be recorded in Freckle under the project "PTO" and tagged as relevant. (e.g. #watchingworldcup)

Coming in when sick is discouraged. Don't give us your germs.

### Leave

The three week notice requirements apply to unpaid leave, to the extent possible. We understand that there are sometimes emergency circumstances which make this type of notice challenging, and management will do its best to approve leave in these circumstances as well.

Unpaid leave is available in increments of less than or equal to 6 weeks at a time.

All unpaid leave must be taken for a reason. The reason can be any reason, but there needs to be one and the employee will submit it to management.

At the beginning of any consecutive unpaid leave period, management reserves the right to determine whether this leave constitutes job abandonment.

#### Parental Leave

Radial will follow the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993](https://www.dol.gov/WHD/fmla/index.htm). In addition to FMLA, the leave policy explained in the previous section is still applicable.

At this time Radial does not offer paid parental leave. If you anticipate needing time off for the birth or adoption of a child, we suggest you plan to use your Paid Time Off. If you need to borrow vacation time from the next year, please speak with management as that may be an option.

We realize everyone has different needs when they return to work after the arrival of a child. Management will work with you to create a plan and make any accommodations necessary, including returning part-time and working up to full-time if that is desired.

### Work From Home/Remote/Flex Time

Work from home, working remotely, and flex time is permitted so long as it does not interfere with project delivery or company training or retrospective.

We will provide facilities, such as we are able, to allow all members of teams
to work in a clean, safe, common, public space.

## Holiday Time

Radial will be closed on the following days and employees are expected to not work.
- Employee Appreciation Day (first Friday in March)
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Thanksgiving Day & the Friday after Thanksgiving
- "Voting Day" (the Monday 8 days before the November Election Day for municipal, county and state elections). **Because Colorado generally votes early by mail, we take the time to research and fill out our ballots on a less-disruptive day.**
- Annual Winter closure as announced
