# Attendance Policy

## Intents and Values

Every opportunity must be afforded an employee to live wholeheartedly at work
and at home. We believe that allowing employees to bring themselves to work is
the best investment we can make into our employees, before professional
development and other perks. We believe that being employed and resourced
based on personal commitments is superior to using shame or a complex
disciplinary policy to enforce a set of rules. As such, we ask all employees
to proactively communicate their commitment to a schedule and to any change to
that schedule, as soon as possible. A failure to effectively communicate
schedule changes or to meet commitments may be grounds for dismissal if not
corrected.

## Schedule

Core hours are from 10am to 3pm M-F. Please be sure to notify the team via email if you are unable to be available during core hours.
Adding absences to your work calendar is necessary so that your planned time off can be accounted for during resource planning.
Client communication should occur between 9am and 6pm M-F only, except by absolute necessity.

## Communication Standards

### Tell your team.

If you will be late to or absent from your committed work schedule, please
contact:

* your supervisor

* any client or client representative that you planned to see during the period
  where you will instead be absent

* especially, your teammates or pair

Please communicate via email.

### Tell them soon.

Please send your notification, by email, as soon as possible, to let your team know if you
will be late or absent. Please also notify Management. You have a responsibility to
make sure we are aware if you will be unable to work, as soon as you know and are able.

Unreported tardies and absences must be made up.

### Communication is a priority.

Furthermore, it is preferred that you arrive 2 hours and 10 minutes late,
rather than to arrive merely 2 hours late without an email. Please take the
time to send an email, before you leave, if you will be late more than 10 minutes.

Please do not send messages while operating a vehicle. Stop. It is more important
that you arrive, than that you arrive on time.

### Keep your team in the loop.

Please put your days off and major appointments on your google calendar as OOO.
Email [team](mailto:team@radialdevgroup.com) to notify them of the days you will be out.
Please update your team if there are any significant changes to your calendar.

## Compensation
### Hourly Employees
Hourly Employees will be paid $31.50/hour, 24 times per year on the 1st or 16th or on the preceding business day.  The pay period ends 5 business days before the pay date.

### Salaried Employees
Salaried Employees will be paid $65,520 per year in 24 payments on the 1st and 16th or on the preceding business day.

## Availability
### Hourly Employees
Hourly employees may set their availability as needed. Changes to availability should be made prior to the Wednesday before the sprint starts, where possible.  Two (2) weeks notice, when possible, is appreciated.

### Salaried Employees
Salaried staff should plan to be available between 10:00am and 3:00pm on days when they are working.

## Furloughs, Hours reduction, etc
### Hourly Employees
Hourly employees may be requested to take a reduction in hours. If so, individuals will be assisted in applying for temporary unemployment benefits, if requested.

## PTO
### Hourly Employees (at 31.50 rate, only)
PTO hours will be accrued at a rate of .268 hours per hour worked.

**Philosophy**:
- In order for part-time or hourly staff to be paid equitably their accrual needs to include the 2 weeks of december closure and 2 weeks of holidays which can be taken as floating holidays or on the date.
- The expectation is that hourly employees will not be compensated for professional development time, but are estimated to spend 3 hours weekly for Retrospectives, 1:1's, and other administrative concerns, totalling 35-hours per week maximum.
- The total accrual is 384.58 hours

### Salaried Employees
PTO Hours will be accrued at a rate of 11.67 Hours per pay period with a maximum of 280 per year.

### Sick Time and Self Care

Life is bumpy. We are happy to accommodate the bumpiness of life. These generally could include items such as being out of the office for a few hours for a doctor's appointment, renewing your driver's license, participating in a citizenship activity, et cetera.  If you are sick or struggling in some other way, you may, having given notice to your team, take the time you need to take to be better.  Having notified your team, you may take up to a day for any sort of self care reason, without prior permission.  Please use PTO for this time.  If you believe that this will limit your ability to take vacation as otherwise scheduled or planned, please request an exception.  Exceptions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may be recategorized 'Personal time' by management, and excused.

If you are sick, stay home. Don't give us your germs.

If you do miss time, you do have the option to make that up within the sprint, however, if you are unable to do so, please add PTO to your time-tracking to account for it.  As with other attendance concerns, this timeline is subject to exception, on a case-by-case basis.

## Internal Time
Depending on the meeting and/or project, the most common Freckle tags may be
"Admin" or "#{internal-project-name}" (see [Time Reporting](TIME_REPORTING.md) for details).
Internal time will be counted towards your 40 hour work week.

Examples of internal time meetings
* Weekly Retrospectives - An all-hands retrospective meeting is held every
  Friday at 9:00 AM. Attendance is required unless you have taken PTO. In-person
  participation is preferred, and infrequent remote attendance is acceptable.

* Trainings - Radial tries to help advance each employee's technical and
  soft skills by providing training opportunities. Effort will be spent on scheduling
  these meetings during business hours.

* Business Development - Employees may be called upon to showcase their technical
  chops in business development meetings. These meetings may be offsite or at the
  Radial offices.
 
## Hack Time

### Explanation

* Provided all project goals are met, any remaining
  time may be used for personal projects or professional development.  Staff activities such as trainings and retrospectives shall take priority over this time. Please allow us to promote any successes relevant to building the company's reputation.

* Please account for your hack time, any networking events or meetups where you
  mention the company, etc., along with other reported times in Freckle.
  
### Hourly Employees
Hourly employees may bill hack time with approval from their manager.

### Salaried Employees
Salaried staff may take/use hack time per the explanation above


## Hour Requirements, Overtime and Comptime

For Salaried employees, 40 hours of work per week will be required. If it is important to client delivery that additional time be spent, please ensure that we are aware so that the entire team can participate.  Please report any client request for overtime, in writing, and in context, as additional fees may apply and additional steps may need to be taken to account for
this time.  No comptime or overtime will be applied except as required by law.

Concering compliance with expectations of 40 hours per week: On a quarterly basis, if there is an meaningful shortage of hours, this will result in a conversation, and chronic shortfall on a shorter time-scale may seperately resuly in a conversation.  Initially, we will identify if the organization or team need to make adjustments to facilitate better compliance; if that is inneffective, we will identify steps and employee should take to bring time-keeping into compliance, and if issues persist, this will become ground for disciplinary action.

In the event that an employee is given business-mandated weekend work, the employee will be given a $45 bonus per instance. This includes working any Saturday or Sunday, working during a scheduled company closure, or any necessary work done after 6 pm.  This time must be identified and approved by Ben.

### Philosophy

Historically, the requirement had been 32 hours of billable work were required.  We discovered, however that this did not give us adequate time to take care of some of the business activities essential to our operation, limited feedback and made it difficult to delegate staff-completeable work.  We also discovered that actually reliably working the 32 hours was also inconsistent.  When in 2017, we changed the requirement to 40 hours, we found that we were much more reliable in completing goals for clients, accounting for sick time and vacation, and more flexibie in what we could resource and plan for.

In 2020, we are revising this policy again because some of the benefits and limits did not align with our goals.  The 40 hour requirement can now be made more flexible to account for the ebb and flow of daily life.  We will not be taking a strict view of this requirement UNLESS it causes a secondary problem or is determined to be a chronic non-compliance issue.

## Leave

The three week notice requirements apply to unpaid leave (except FMLA), to the extent possible. We understand that there are sometimes emergency circumstances which make this type of notice challenging, and management will do its best to approve leave in these circumstances as well.

Unpaid leave is available in increments of less than or equal to 6 weeks at a time.

All unpaid leave must be taken for a reason. The reason can be any reason, but there needs to be one and the employee will submit it to management.

At the beginning of any consecutive unpaid leave period, management reserves the right to determine whether this leave constitutes job abandonment.

#### Parental Leave

Radial will follow the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993](https://www.dol.gov/WHD/fmla/index.htm). In addition to FMLA, the leave policy explained in the previous section is still applicable.

At this time Radial does not offer paid parental leave. However, you can sign up for Short Term Disability through Aflac*. If you anticipate needing more paid time off for the birth or adoption of a child, we suggest you plan to use your Paid Time Off. If you need to borrow vacation time from the next year, please speak with management as that may be an option.

We realize everyone has different needs when they return to work after the arrival of a child. Management will work with you to create a plan and make any accommodations necessary, including returning part-time and working back up to full-time if that is desired.

*Open Enrollment for Aflac is in December each year, with new plans starting Jan 1.

*At the time of this writing, Aflac's Short Term Disability policy offers the following for Maternity Leave:
> You must have the policy in place 10 full months before delivery
>
> Normal delivery is 6 weeks of paid leave less the waiting period of 7 or 14 days which ever the employee has chosen
>
> C-Section is 8 weeks of paid leave less the waiting period of 7 or 14 days which ever the employee has chosen

### Work From Home/Remote/Flex Time

Work from home, working remotely, and flex time is permitted so long as it does not interfere with project delivery or company training or retrospective.

We will provide facilities, such as we are able, to allow all members of teams
to work in a clean, safe, common, public space.

## Holiday Time

Radial will be closed on the following days and employees are expected to not work.
- Employee Appreciation Day (first Friday in March)
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Thanksgiving Day & the Friday after Thanksgiving
- "Voting Day" (the Monday 8 days before the November Election Day for municipal, county and state elections). **Because Colorado generally votes early by mail, we take the time to research and fill out our ballots on a less-disruptive day.**
- Annual Winter closure as announced
