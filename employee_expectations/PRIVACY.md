## General

It shall be the official position of the organization that information stored or shared in company accounts, is readable, at-will by management; some information is public to the organization by default and is readable by all staff.  If you have specific concerns, please address them to management.

It is not the policy of management to utilize the laxness of this privacy policy to invade the personal lives of staff.

## Email
Please consider that all business communication should occur via company accounts, but apart from that, no restriction of use of personal accounts applies.  Please consider that management does not plan to review company email accounts, but access to your email cannot be restricted within "G suite." One should not consider your work email to be private and should assume that it will be read.

Whenever one should leave the company, email accounts are removed and all futher correspondence goes to the wildcard address, readable by management.  Management will receive any correspondence recieved to your account thereafter.

#Calendar
Defaults for calendars allow anyone in the organization to see one's calendar, including descriptions, etc. Personal information should not be included in calendar item Descriptions.

**If you would like help setting up a way to view this information along-side your work calendar without exposing your information, a time can be scheduled with management for training on this, if needed.**
