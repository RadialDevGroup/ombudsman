# Facilities Process

We all want to work in a clean environment, but that requires everyone to pitch in.

If you bring in food for the office, THANK YOU! We love food! We don't want
that food to spoil though, so it is your responsibility to ensure that it
gets taken care of (put in the fridge, thrown away, taken home, etc) by the
end of the day.

Anything you use that needs to be washed should be put on the counter by the end of the day on Fridays for the cleaning crew to take care of.

Empty the fridge of all your belongings on Friday before you leave.

At the end of each day, please tidy up your space. No one likes to see plastic cups or food left around.

## Bathroom

If you use the last of the toilet paper or paper towels, bring in new toilet paper from the storage closet.

If the storage closet is running low (fewer than 8 rolls of paper towels, or 10 rolls of TP) on any of these items, notify Management or the Armory.

If the trash can in the bathroom is full, either take it out or notify [Management](../ORGANIZATIONAL_STRUCTURE.md#management) or the Armory that it needs to be taken out.

## Trashcan

The trash bags are in the cabinet adjacent to the trash can. When the trash in the can is level with the top of the can, replace the bag. The old bag goes in the dumpster on the north side of the building. Trashcan Jenga is disallowed.
