# Facilities Process

We all want to work in a clean environment, but that requires everyone to pitch in.

If you bring in food for the office, THANK YOU! We love food! We don't want
that food to spoil though, so it is your responsibility to ensure that it
gets taken care of (put in the fridge, thrown away, taken home, etc) by the
end of the day.

Anything you use that needs to be washed should be put on the counter by the end of the day on Fridays for the cleaning crew to take care of.

Empty the fridge of all your belongings on Friday before you leave.

At the end of each day, please tidy up your space. No one likes to see plastic cups or food left around.
