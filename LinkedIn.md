# LinkedIn Methodology

At the recommendation of a mentor, this is how we might approach leveraging linkedin:
## Domain
- A niche domain such as online-portals for 3d-printed medical technology and ecommerce.
- A geographic area and an organizational role and search specific income/revenue levels
- A particular area of competing or paralell business, such as website consulting professionals

## Practice
Visit the profiles of said professionals and repost content relevant to our authority or value areas.
Set our LinkedIn profiles as followable (principally mine, or we ask Marshall to participate, also)
When we are followed, or connection requests are made, we accept and continue to promote other creators in the space.
Seperately, we create content that links back to our site that is relevant to our domain.
