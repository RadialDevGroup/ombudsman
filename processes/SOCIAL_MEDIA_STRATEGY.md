### Posting Strategy
- Determine your Twitter audience and create a tone that matches their demographics and interests
  * Focused domains: Process. Test driven development, React, Javascript, Rails, Python/Django/Flask/CherryPy. Process
- Provide your own content by tweeting one content post each day. This might include:
  * Blog topics
  * Event updates

- Retweet up to two posts from varied account sources along with the daily content post. This might include:
  * Quotes from industry leaders (Contact connections and ask for Q & A)
  * Relevant articles (ex. Hacker News, or Buzzsumo for trending articles)
  * Local news or events
- Hashtag strategy: Utilize sites like Fanpage Karma, that allow you research a company and view their top hashtags, as well as providing other valuable information on the company. Doing this periodically can help you keep up with trends within the tech industry, and can be an asset to increasing reach of your posts through utilizing these hashtags.
  * Review competitor audit for current hashtags
- Photo usage: Studies show tweets with images can get 60-200% more shares than those without. That being said, only add an image to a post if it helps back up your content, not distract from it.


### Audience Engagement Strategy
Post material that promote your viewers to be interactive, or give them an incentive to share your company insight.
- Use analytic tools that can identify users that are being interactive, in order to figure out how to cater to that audience.
  * Current Platforms: Twitonomy (Radial follower analytics) and Followerwonk (source for competitor anaylsis)
- Take part in industry specific Live Twitter Chats: View Twitter spreadsheet on Google Docs to view topics, times, and dates
- Propose questions about corresponding topics, or offer help to viewers that have specific technology related questions. This will help you gain insight to what viewers are interested in learning which will assist in future content creation, and will boosts Radial’s reputation by being associated as a helpful company.
- Tweet about industry events to engage with local companies, which will inform readers while boosting our brand image in the eye of other companies.
- Consider running a contest in order to gain more interaction from followers, and our followers followers. Contests could include:
  * Asking a question or problem and providing an award for the best response
  * Awarding those for sharing your post in a sweepstakes
- Following/Follower Strategy
  * Create competitor lists: Keep track of in order to gain information from their posts to help write content, and to be up to date with popular industry topics and discussions.
  * Create local company lists: Makes it easier to interact with local companies by retweeting content posts, and promoting events.
  * Consider promoting followers in order to increase reach (one of the ads, around $1.50 per follower)


 ## Blogs


### Posting Strategy
- The Radial blog should be posted to once a week. Developers/employees will be assigned responsibility for a blog on a rotating schedule.
- Responsibility does not mean you have to write the blog, it just means you have to make sure someone writes it and posts it.
- We aim to work one week ahead, so a blog running on Thursday of the week of 8/21/2017 should be completed at the latest by Friday 8/18/2017.
- In practice this means you should write your blog on Monday or Tuesday of the week before it posts.
- Clarify the blog topic with the blog editor sometime before you sit down to write it. After writing it, share it with the blog editor so s/he can edit it. (Share link in #content-development Slack channel).
- After you get edits, either you or the blog editor should place the blog into the CMS.
- Blogs should be set to post Thursday morning at 1 a.m.
- If you know you will be out of town the week you are responsible for a blog, it's your responsibility to write it in advance or find someone else who will take care of it for you.


### Content
- All blogs should be edited. Let someone else read it before it's posted!
- A list of possible blog topics is on the Asana board
- Please add blog topic ideas to the list any time you think of one.
- Blogs should be a mix of technical and non-technical posts. Choose your topic with an eye to what has been recently posted and try to balance technical posts with non-technical.
- Blogs with subheadings are better than blogs without subheadings.
- Blogs with short sentences are better than blogs with long sentences. Try to follow some of the readability tips from Yost in the CMS.
- Blogs with external links are better than blogs without external links. So try to link out if you can. External links should be set to open in new tabs.
- Blogs with images are better than blogs without images. Screenshots are also good. You can annotate screenshots using Skitch. If a screenshot doesn't work, you can grab an appropriate image from such free-for-commercial-use sites as:
  * Pixabay (stock photos)
  * Pexels (stock photos)
  * Unsplash (stock photos)
  * Government images


## Promotion: Cross posting on Blogs
- TWITTER: Once a blog has a permalink, an employee with access to the Radial Twitter account on Tweetdeck should schedule the blog to be tweeted out, once on the day it runs, and once on the following day. (In practice this means Slack the permalink to Ben or Stephanie and they will schedule the Tweets)
  * If you have a Twitter account, we encourage retweeting your own blog posts or those of other Radial employees.
  * Update Twitter 3 times a week on topics related to blog posts
- QUORA:
  * Question and answer site. Actively find questions that relate to blog post topics, and provide an answer with the specific blog link referenced. (If there aren't relevant questions relating to your blog, consider asking an anonymous question)
- HACKER NEWS
  * Post blog content directly onto website
  * Post old blogs that have not yet been featured on the site once a week
- MEDIUM
  * Change title of blog post, then post directly onto website


  ## Strategy Review Period
- Analyze the overall social media highs and lows at the end of each period
- Ask yourself: Is the social media content continuing to uphold company values? Are posts reaching the companies intended audience?
- Analyze results and measure progress: Use current data analytics tools attached to each account to gain a better understanding of social media growth and engagement.
  * Example questions to ask: What posts and topics were attractive to your target market? What are the demographics of subscribers/viewers? What percentage of views are organic? What type of social media posts drove the most engagement?
- Adjust current strategy: Is everything listed in the strategy still valuable and relevant to the current state of the company, or do revisions need to be made?
- Set goals: Implement a new set of goals that align with your current social media strategy every period.Fill out the following to have a clear outline of the previous goals set, and the direction you are taking in the future, and save it to a document that is accessible to all marketing admin:
  * The following worked well to reach my goal…
  * The following did not work so well..
  * My goal for next period is..
  * In order to reach that goal I will make these changes in my social media strategy..
