# Introduction
Radial is transforming its image from a software development company, to a cultural consulting company that provides software designed around those needs. The purpose of extending our current marketing strategy is to achieve the following goals:
Successfully market to people that will allow us to maintain our values while working with them. 
- We want to build relationships with our clients that are founded on open communication. We must understand our core differences before building a partnership that can provide solutions for the distinguished goals of each company. 
- Become a valued company within the community, through diversification of project deliverables and participation in a variety of community events and outreach. 
- Successfully market ourselves as a culture first company. We are focused on understanding a client before diving into the project scope, and it is important that our clients and find value in that.

## Pitch
We designate developer leads who will carry you through the life of your project. They listen deeply to discover your key needs and will work with you to craft a solution that directly addresses your business problem.

The hardest part of solving a problem with technology is solving the right problem.  We discover valuable technology problems and help to define requirements and specifications for solutions.  We write the software ourselves and can help you develop a valuable asset, team, or provide a long-term relationship that continues to solve challenges as your organization grows and evolves
Transitioning to new technology is more than a technical problem.  Ensure that a solution is right for your organization is about making the right changes to your organization that will allow it to add value for everyone involved -- ensuring that new solutions are adopted and enable productivity improvements
Communication is the biggest challenge you'll overcome when you successfully scale.  Scaling via technology is about working with a partner who will help you solve each communication challenge you face as you define success within the scope of technology initiatives
The app that best solves your problem is the one you create yourself -- we this we can make that possible for your organization, regardless of your existing technical skills, staff or budget.
There is no way to modernize an organization without buy-in from its constituents.  Our discovery process is designed to unite diverse constituencies around and effective solution.  We have done that at Woodward, Magnum, and [other places]
