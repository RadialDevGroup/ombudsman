#Introduction

Radial is transforming its pitch from marketing itself as a software development company, to a cultural consulting company that builds software designed around meeting company's business needs while helping them develop a culture that empowers them to successfully integrate that software into their company. The purpose of extending our current marketing strategy is to achieve the following goals:

- Successfully market to companies who will allow us to maintain our values while working with them. 
- We want to build relationships with our clients that are founded on open communication. We must understand our core differences before building a partnership that can provide solutions for the distinguished goals of each company. 
- Become a valued company within the community, through diversification of project deliverables and participation in a variety of community events and outreach. 
- Successfully market ourselves as a culture-first company. We are focused on understanding a client before diving into the project scope, and it is important that our clients and find value in that.

##Pitch
We are great software developers. But the hardest part of building custom software is making sure the problem you are solving with technology is the problem that needs to be solved. The second hardest part is integrating that solution into your company culture. We do both.

We designate developer leads who will carry you through the life of your project. They listen deeply to discover your key needs and will work with you to craft a solution that directly addresses your business problem.

- Our discovery process is purpose-built with a strong front-end listening component to ensure we are solving the right problems, before we write even one line of code. Once we hone in on the core business problem/problems, we define requirements and specifications for solutions.  We write the software ourselves so it is fully customizable. We work side-by-side with you to develop your own team to work with the software, or if desired, we can provide a long-term relationship that continues to solve challenges as your organization grows and evolves.
- Communication is the biggest challenge you'll face when you successfully scale.  Scaling via technology is about working with a partner who will help you solve each communication challenge you face as you define success within the scope of technology initiatives. Our communication process ensures that the hard stuff is discussed in order to develop trusting relationships that are key to a successful partnership. 
We are comfortable communicating the hard stuff, in order to ensure that your definition of success is met. 
- The app that best solves your problem is the one you create yourself -- we this we can make that possible for your organization, regardless of your existing technical skills or staff know-how..
- There is no way to modernize an organization without buy-in from its constituents.  Our discovery process is designed to unite diverse constituencies within a business around and effective solution.  We have done that for our existing clients.
