## New Employee Schedule

### First Day
- Paperwork (takes about an hour)
- This is when Ben should communicate to developers about the new hireâ€™s schedule and who they will be shadowing
- Take photo and add to website
- Meet and greet/team lunch

### Shadowing developers
[Shadowing Checklist](./CULTURAL_DISCOVERY_PROCESS.md)
- The purpose of shadowing is to learn how and why we do things
- The new employee should shadow two developers for two days each, and complete the checklist during this period

### Beyond the first week
- a sprint of shadowing a lead (this should happen at some point)
- check google drive for what process is documented for lead developers
