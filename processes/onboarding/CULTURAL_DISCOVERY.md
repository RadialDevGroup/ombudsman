# Cultural Discovery Process

### The Beginning of Radial

- Our initial goal was to create a company that was authentic
    - We had to have continuity and vulnerability
    - Cultural continuity required us to be culturally articulate
    - Vulnerability required us to be confident
- We wanted a culture that allowed us to achieve our goals
    - A culture is comprised of values. For culture to be a tool, its structure had to be defined

### Example value - COURAGE:
- We realized that if we didn't grow we would eventually die a slow death
- Secondary goal: prioritize communication and accountability
- Tertiary goal: we're gonna do hard stuff -- work w/ ppl no one wants to work with, make things work, helping people who have made mistakes

  **Anecdote**: When you're at a consultancy, you can always find work. The easiest kind is work with no clear goals (poorly defined definition of success). You can always create a good feeling during the sales process, with no regard for delivery or the end product. However you will end up with an unsatisfied client.

  Without articulated goals, there are no shared goals, and therefore no path to customer recovery. You have to find a balance between work that allows the company to survive, and work that lets the company thrive. Some companies, in an effort to survive, only seek out the former type of work. But without work that results in growth, eventually the company will die to attrition.

## Exercise:

- Types of goals to be documented:
  - personal career goals
  - personal goals at Radial
  - goals about how Radial will be

- Journal about:
    - Negative and positive work experiences
    - Document the above goals based on those work experiences
    - Express the goals in 3-7 values
- *Prompts for journaling*
    - What are your goals at the company?
    - What goals would you like Radial to meet?
    - Why are you here?
