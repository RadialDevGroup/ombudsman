## Cultural Discovery Process
### The Beginning of Radial

- Our goal was to create a company that was authentic
    - We had to have continuity and vulnerability
    - Continuity required us to be articulate
    - Vulnerability required us to confident
- We had to define our values... which is difficult; so we started with goals
    - what did we want our values to do?


### Example value - COURAGE:
- Our main goal was to grow or die
- Secondary goal: prioritize communication and accountability
- Tertiary goal: we're gonna do hard stuff -- work w/ ppl no one wants to work with, make things work, helping people who have made mistakes

  **Anecdote**: When you're at a consultancy, you can always find work. The easiest kind is work with no clear goals (poorly defined definition of success). You can always create a good feeling during the sales process, with no regard for delivery or the end product. What you will end up with is an unsatisfied client.

  Without articulated goals, then there are no shared goals, and therefore no path to customer recovery. You have to find a balance between work that allows the company to survive, and work that let's the company thrive. Some companies, in an effort to survive, only seek out the former type of work. But without work that results in growth, eventually the company will die to attrition.


## Exercise:

- Journal about:
    - Negative and positive work experiences
    - Document goals based on those work experiences
- *Prompts for journaling*
    - what are your goals at the company?
    - what goals would you like Radial to meet?
    - Why are you here?
- Express the goals in 3-7 values
