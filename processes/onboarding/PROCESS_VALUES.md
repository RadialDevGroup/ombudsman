# Process is values-driven

## Company Values

### Accountability
- Effective team members pursue processes, practices and personal policies that ensure that they are accountable to the team, supervisors and reports
- Retrospectives will be done as needed; have someone moderate who does not have a stake in the retrospective
- Subject your work and decision processes to review by peers

### Empathy
- Take your own needs and the personal needs of others into account when making decisions
- Listen to connect when working with clients
- Consider what other needs a client may have when clarifying specifications

### Care

- Be as concerned with how something is done as you are with getting it done
- Be kind
- Understand the values and needs of others

### Collaboration

- Take every opportunity to work with others.
- Never exclude or ignore others' opinions
- Show your work
- Communicate effectively, proactively, and completely
- Respect others' time

### Courage

- Do the hard things.
- Say no
- Set boundaries with others
- Act on the other values even when it might cost you something in the short term

## Attendance

Every opportunity must be afforded an employee to live wholeheartedly at work and at home. We believe that allowing employees to bring themselves to work is the best investment we can make into our employees, before professional development and other perks. We believe that being employed and resourced based on personal commitments is superior to using shame or a complex disciplinary policy to enforce a set of rules. As such, we ask all employees to proactively communicate their commitment to a schedule and to any change to that schedule, as soon as possible. A failure to effectively communicate schedule changes or to meet commitments may be grounds for dismissal if not corrected.

## Performance

Whereas many organizations, especially prospective clients, may judge performance on the basis of completion or on the basis of estimates versus actual work, my experience suggests that this only accommodates those who would knowingly game the system. Therefore, we are resolved not to tie performance evaluations to quantitative measures of performance but wish to herein elucidate the behaviors which we wish to encourage and which will be used to define success or failure within our organizations
