# Process is values-driven

## Attendance

Every opportunity must be afforded an employee to live wholeheartedly at work and at home. We believe that allowing employees to bring themselves to work is the best investment we can make into our employees, before professional development and other perks. We believe that being employed and resourced based on personal commitments is superior to using shame or a complex disciplinary policy to enforce a set of rules. As such, we ask all employees to proactively communicate their commitment to a shedule and to any change to that schedule, as soon as possible. A failure to effectively communicate schedule changes or to meet commitments may be grounds for dismissal if not corrected.
