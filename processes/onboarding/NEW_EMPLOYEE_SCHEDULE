## New Employee Schedule

### First Day
- Paperwork takes about an hour
- This is when Ben should communicate to developers about the new hireâ€™s schedule and who they will be shadowing
- Meet and greet/team lunch

### First Day afternoon
- Go over Radial's Communication Tools (cultural orientation in onboarding policy)
- Explain company values (in Google Drive)

### 2 days of shadowing a developer and 2 days of shadowing another developer
- The purpose of shadowing is to learn programming process flow
  - git flow (pull requests etc)
  - slack
  - commenting on pull requests
  - story tools (tracker etc)
  - completing work (how to choose/complete a story, what to do when stuck)
  - check google drive for what process is documented for lead developers

### Beyond the first week
- a sprint of shadowing a lead (this should happen at some point)
