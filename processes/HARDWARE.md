# Hardware Process

As a matter of general service offerings, Radial Development does not do
hardware repair but we may make an exception, strictly at our own discretion.
On the rare occasion that we make such an exception, we should have a process
for how it will be done; If possible, please refer to [Rob Protzman <rob@charteredtech.com >](mailto:rob@charteredtech.com), [Michael Vogt <michaelvogt52@gmail.com>](mailto:michaelvogt52@gmail.com), [Millenium Group](Screen Shot 2017-11-15 at 1.28.37 PM alias), or another (insured and
qualified) IT or computer support technician.

We recommend that everyone maintain a support contract on their equipment to
prevent loss, via Dell Onsite, Applecare, HP 24-hour, GeekSquad, etc.

Given that any hardware work will follow these guidelines:

1. Ensure that we are insured in the event of damage at fault.

1. Verify the functional state of machine prior to start of work:
    - Verify Screen Functionality
    - Verify Computer Boot
    - Run Video Benchmark (note any anomalies)
    - Run DXDiag (note any failures)
    - Test Sound, Network Connectivity

1. Confirm work to be done with client.

1. Verify the integrity of replacement parts if available or applicable.

1. Perform service.

1. Verify that the system works with parity to orginal state of machine.

1. Verify repairs are completed succefully.

1. Document at every step.

At Radial Development, we stand behind the expertise of our staff, but not the
quality and workmanship of other companies' equipment (e.g. Dell, HP, Lenovo).
