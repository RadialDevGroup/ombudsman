# Hardware Process

Radial Development does not do hardware repair, however, on the rare occasion
that we do it, we should have a process for how it will be done; If possible,
please refer end-use to PC's and Parts on 29th, Rob Protzman, Jamie Leben,
Millenium Group, an insured qualified IT or computer support technician.

We recommend that everyone maintain a support contract on their equipment
to prevent loss.  Dell Onsite, Applecare, HP 24-hour, etc.

Given that any hardware work will follow these guidelines:

1. Ensure that we are ensured in the event of damage at fault.

1. Verify the functional state of machine prior to start of work:

- Does Screen Work
- Does Computer Boot up
- Run Vdeo Benchmark and note any anomalies
- Run DXDiag and note any failures
- Test Sound and network connectivity

1. Confirm work to be done with client

1. Verify the integrity of replacement or new parts if available or applicable.

1. Perform Service

1. Verify that the system works with parity to orginal state of machine

1. Verify repair completed succefully.

Radial development stands behind the expoertise of our staff, but no the quality and workmanship of other companies' equipment: Dell, HP, etc included.
