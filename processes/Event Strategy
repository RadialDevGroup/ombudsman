#Event Strategy 
Before participating, presenting, or attending an event, it is important to determine how it would benefit Radial, Loveland community members, or clientele. 

Goals:

- Gain 1 referral/year from networking through events.
- Gain 1 new skunkworks project/year through nonprofit event participation/hosting.
- Increase Twitter followers by 10% per quarter from direct connections made at events.
- Increase site traffic by 5% following an event.

##Considerations of Participation 
- Identify goals of event: Who will this benefit or what value will this bring to Radial
- What is the minimum level of participation that will help you achieve these goals: Attending? Presenting? Sponsoring? Hosting?
- What channels will we use to promote the event, or share our contributions? Consider what audiences we are trying to reach, and what social platforms would reach that audience.
- Post event: How did you track whether this event boosted audience engagement or viewers on our online channels? How did we follow up with new connections? Was this event something that we would like to continue future involvement with? If so, how will we ensure our future participation? 

##Tracking/Documentation 
- Use this form to document meetups, events, and creator spaces. Make note of what you have attended, and if they met our company goals. Continue to add new events as needed- meetup.com is a good source for local tech meetups.
- Use Marketing Google Calendar to keep track of upcoming events.
  * Once a month updates are necessary to ensure validity of information.

##Event Hosting
Before considering hosting an event, answer the following:

- What is the goal of hosting this event? Who or what will it benefit?
- Are there other events already in place that are working to achieve the same outcome? If so:
  * Would a partnership make sense with the competition organizations/events, rather than creating our own event?
  * What are the benefits to hosting this event rather than attending other events currently in place? 
  * What what will set us apart from other events done by other organizations?
  * Do we have the resources to successfully meet our goals for this event? 

Once a purpose and related goals are defined for hosting an event, an action plan should be implemented. This should include:

- Timeline
  * Define key steps in the planning process, and set a timeline to reflect each step. 
Is there a specific time of the year that this should take place? What about a specific time or day of the week?
- Involvement
  * Sponsorships: Determine what companies would benefit from becoming a sponsor- See list for potential local sponsors. 
  * Participants: How will you attract attendees, and who will you be targeting? Consider competitor list, students, and meet-up participants. 
  * Non-profits: If this is a non-profit event, see list of local organizations. 
- Promotion/Contacting
  * Online: What kind of platforms will you use to increase awareness? (i.e Twitter, company website, event specific website, quarterly newsletter mention, etc.)
  * What will you do to increase event awareness locally? (i.e Attend tech events to promote the event, reach out to local companies to get media promotion, campus advertisements, etc.)
  * How will you reach sponsors, partners, or nonprofits? Resource:
