# Developer Lead Policy

## Technical Decisions
1. The developer lead is responsible for making all engineering decisions on their
  designated project.
2. In the absence of the developer lead (i.e. if they are out of the office,
  unable to be reached, etc.), any engineering decisions that diverge from the
  original plan cannot be made until the developer lead has been contacted and
  approved the change.
3. If you feel that an engineering decision was made incorrectly or if you feel
  that your current story is blocked by an engineering decision, you are
  required to contact your developer lead to discuss.
4. If you are not a developer lead and would like to propose a change,
  you must present your argument to the developer lead with ample documentation
  for your conclusion. Evaluate every alternative before making a decision.
5. If the developer lead does not agree with your proposal and you feel strongly
  further engineering discussions should occur, bring this up in weekly retrospective
  or contact Lindsay and either Ben or Marshall to continue the discussion.

## Responsibility for Previous Clients
When a previous Radial client re-engages with us, the individual who was the developer lead
when the project ended will be responsible for managing the previous client.
