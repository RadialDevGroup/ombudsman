# Blogging policy

## Timing
1. The Radial blog should be posted to once a week. Developers/employees will be assigned responsibility for a blog on a rotating schedule. Responsibility does not mean you have to write the blog, it just means you have to make sure someone writes it and posts it.
2. We aim to work one week ahead, so a blog running on Thursday of the week of 8/21/2017 should be completed at the latest by Friday 8/18/2017.
3. In practice this means you should write your blog on Monday or Tuesday of the week before it posts.
4. Clarify the blog topic with the blog editor sometime before you sit down to write it. After writing it, share it with the blog editor so s/he can edit it. (Share link in #content-development Slack channel).
5. After you get edits, either you or the blog editor should place the blog into the
6. Blogs should be set to post Thursday morning at 1 a.m.
7. If you know you will be out of town the week you are responsible for a blog, it's your responsibility to write it in advance or find someone else who will take care of it for you.

## Content
1. All blogs should be edited. Let someone else read it before it's posted!
2. A list of possible blog topics is on the [Asana board](https://app.asana.com/0/34623129993106/list)
3. Please add blog topic ideas to the list any time you think of one.
4. Blogs should be a mix of technical and non-technical posts. Choose your topic with an eye to what has been recently posted and try to balance technical posts with non-technical.
5. Blogs with subheadings are better than blogs without subheadings.
6. Blogs with short sentences are better than blogs with long sentences. Try to follow some of the readability tips from Yost in the CMS.
7. Blogs with external links are better than blogs without external links. So try to link out if you can. External links should be set to open in new tabs.
8. Blogs with images are better than blogs without images. Screenshots are also good. You can annotate screenshots using [Skitch](https://evernote.com/products/skitch). If a screenshot doesn't work, you can grab an appropriate image from such free-for-commercial-use sites as:
- [Pixabay (stock photos)](https://pixabay.com/)
- [Pexels (stock photos)](https://www.pexels.com/)
- [Unsplash (stock photos)](https://unsplash.com/)

## Before you post
- [ ] Did you add a featured image? Is this image horizontal?
- [ ] Did you add tags?
- [ ] Do your links open in a new tab?
- [ ] Does your post have a picture?
- [ ] Are there subheadings?
- [ ] Did you set the author to the correct author?
- [ ] Did you double check your posting date?

## Promotion
1. Once a blog has a permalink, an employee with access to the Radial Twitter account on Tweetdeck should schedule the blog to be tweeted out, once on the day it runs, and once on the following day.
(In practice this means Slack the permalink to Ben or Stephanie and they will schedule the Tweets)
2. If you have a Twitter account, we encourage retweeting your own blog posts or those of other Radial employees.
