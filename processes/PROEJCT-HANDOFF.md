# Project leadership handoffs

## Intent
Under normal cicumstances, some members of the team, particularly members of leadership, will be away doing business, on alternate schedules for deployments, on vacation, or out on personal leave.  It is important that we accomadate the humanity of every employee, but project leadership handoffs must be made if the project lead / developer lead on the project will be unavailable.  This process should address continuation of execellent execution by providing a project handoff process.

## Concerning throwing the project over the wall
Sales Team members, Account management, Operations, and Management who delegate a project shall not assume that the developer picking up the project will know what to with it, in its current state.  A status-of-project email should be communicated to the new Project Lead for any project, whenever responsiblity for the project or customer relationship changes.

## Concerning the customer
Whoever is currently responsible for the project is responsible to introduce the new responsible team member to the client before becoming unavailable.  It encouraged that a canned response be prepared so that the email may be sent at short notice, if necessary.  If the client already knows the new responsible team member, they should recieve notice that for [Busines reason, explicit | Reasons of Personal Emergency | Stanard reasons (Vacation | Sick | etc), explicit ] that the current lead will be temporarily unavailable and inform them of the new POC, cc their email. With permission, please provide the new POC's phone number for emergencies during the transition.  WE may use zirtual for this at some point.

## Work in progress
All work in progress should be reassigned and thoroughly explained to new assignee, in person or over hangout prior to departure.
