# Project leadership handoffs

## Intent
Under normal cicumstances, some members of the team, particularly members of leadership, will be away doing business, on alternate schedules for deployments, on vacation, or out on personal leave.  It is important that we accommodate the humanity of every employee, but project leadership handoffs must be made if the project lead / developer lead on the project will be unavailable.  This process should address continuation of execellent execution by providing a project handoff process.

## Timeline
When possible, the responsible person will notify the client of the handoff no less than one week from the day of the handoff.  This allows the client to adjust to the idea, and ask any questions before the change takes place.

## Concerning throwing the project over the wall
Sales Team members, Account management, Operations, and Management who delegate a project shall not assume that the  new lead is familiar with the state of the project.  A status-of-project email should be communicated to the new Project Lead for any project, whenever responsiblity for the project or customer relationship changes.

- Recommendations requested for status criteria [Issue 19](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/issues/19)

## Concerning the customer
Whoever is currently responsible for the project will to introduce the new responsible team member to the client before becoming unavailable.  If the client already knows the new responsible team member, they should recieve notice that for [Busines reason, explicit | Reasons of Personal Emergency | Stanard reasons (Vacation | Sick | etc), explicit ] that the current lead will be unavailable and inform them of the new point-of-contact (POC), cc their email. With permission, please provide the new POC's phone number for emergencies during the transition.  We may consider using a virtual assistant service for this, at some point.

- Template email requested [Issue 20](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/issues/20)

## Work in progress
All work in progress should be reassigned and thoroughly explained to new assignee, in person or over hangout prior to departure.  This meeting should be echoed in an email and CC'd to management
