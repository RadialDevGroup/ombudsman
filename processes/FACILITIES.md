# Facilities Process

We all want to work in a clean environment, but that requires everyone to pitch in.

If you bring in food for the office, THANK YOU! We love food! We don't want that food to spoil though, so it is your responsibility to 
ensure that it gets taken care of (put in the fridge, thrown away, taken home, etc) by the end of the day.

We all understand forgetting to wash something right away, but if you use a cup or something else that needs to be cleaned, please wash 
it (there is a sink in the Armory) by the end of the day on Fridays.
