# Project README

The README for your project should guide developers to installing and starting work on the project. A developer with a computer set up for the language being used should be able to follow the instructions and successfully deploy the project in less than thirty minutes without additional assistance. Where possible, this document should link or point to root sources for information such as version information (e.g. a gemfile). Likewise, domain specific documentation should be maintained in the project wiki.  The more concise and direct this README document is, the more likely it will be read in its entirety.

#### If you are starting a new project, you may copy one of the following boilerplate templates:
- [Generic](readme/README.generic.md)
- [Python](readme/README.python.md)
- [Ruby](readme/README.ruby.md)
- [Javascript](readme/README.javascript.md)

---

**Your README should include the following sections:**

---

# Project Name

A short description of the project describing the main purpose of the software.

Example:
> This web application provides a sign up form for new members and a reporting engine on vendors and referral partners.

## Technology and Stack

This should be a list of technologies in use and links to the associated documentation beginning with the language and framework and including any libraries that a developer should be familiar with. Consider including a section for testing tools.

Link to the developer journey for the language and framework. Guide the reader to where to locate the versions used. When installing a project for the first time it is important to review the documentation for any items that are unfamiliar.

## Setup

Instructions for setting up the project for development.

If any secret environment variables are needed, include instructions for where to obtain them.

Conclude with instructions for how to verify the install was successful such as walking through the happy path instructions in the wiki. If this is a mobile app, this may require completing the app deploy process.

## Development server

The command for running the dev server. If there are default user accounts, link to the seeds file that contains the information or a wiki page.

## Testing

The command for running the tests.

## Deployment

Link to wiki for deployment instructions (especially for mobile apps). Include instructions for obtaining any necessary secret environment variables. Often, environment variables can be obtained directly from the server (e.g. Heroku or Netlify) if the developer has access.

## Troubleshooting/OS variances

Provide instructions for overcoming any commonly encountered issues with setup and development here (if any).

## Development Process

Link to `PROCESS.md` If you don't have one you can copy a template from https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/blob/master/processes/PROCESS.md (click on *raw* to copy).

Link to style guide. This might an external style guide or a project `STYLEGUIDE.md` that may be based on another style guide.

## Deployment History

Every time the project is successfully deployed a commit should be made to the README with the date, OS Version, and XCode version as well as any corrections or missing information.
