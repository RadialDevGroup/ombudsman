#Website/Analytics
In order to determine how our marketing efforts are correlated with Radialâ€™s growth, it is important to maintain knowledge of the analytics of the company website (social media specific analytics will be found in the social media strategy). 
Utilize Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager to track the following:

- Monitor increased site traffic: Are these visitors new or revisiting?
  * Goal: Increase weekly site traffic by 10 people on average by the end of the quarter.
- Monitor length of site visits: What articles or areas of the site are holding viewer interests for the longest period of time?
  * Goal: Average site views increase to >2 minutes by the end of the quarter. Review Quarterly and update this goal
- Monitor number of pages visited in each session, and what pages are being most visited.
  * Goal: Average page views in a session, >3 by the end of the quarter. Review quarterly and update this document 
  * Goal: >2% click rate to the contact us page by the end of the quarter. Review Quarterly and update this document
- Monitor diversity of visitor referrals to site: What social media or website channels are drawing the most people to the site? Why are these platforms attracting a larger audience than others?
  * Goal: Increase users from Twitter to 5 people a week by the end of the quarter. Review Quarterly and update this document
  * Goal: Update Facebook page. Increase users from Facebook to 2 people a week. Review Quarterly and update this document
  * Goal: If resources are available, begin answering questions on Quora to diversify viewer channels. Review Quarterly and update this document

##Additional notes:
- Google analytics: 
  * IMPORTANT: You will see a Test View, and a Master View when in the Admin tab. Test view differs because of its use of a hostname and spam filters, which will give a more representational view of actual site visitors. Add additional filters if needed, but **always keep both the test and master view**. 
  * Track goals using the goals feature in Admin View. These can be edited quarterly depending on whether or not they have met the goals from last quarter, and new goals can be added. Make sure to update the Website/Analytics strategy each quarter to be consistent with Google Analytics goals.
