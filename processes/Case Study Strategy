# Case Studies
Case studies are a good way to leverage Radialâ€™s success stories, while also working to promote the client of the given project. Case studies are valuable content for our website, LinkedIn, and quarterly newsletters, and can be used as direct work examples when meeting with potential clients in similar industries or with similar needs. 
  * Important consideration: Due issues related to privacy, it is essential for Radial to have all case studies approved by the client to ensure we have permission to disclose the content before publishing  a case study about their project.

## Goals: 
- Creation: Draft two case studies every quarter (These should be professionally edited before posting). 
- Promotion: Share case studies on company website (under Case Studies tab), repost on twitter, and provide an article link on the LinkedIn page. Also make sure to share in our newsletter as a quarterly highlight. 
- Increase page visits on the case studies page to >3 minutes.
  * How: When reposting a newsletter on social media sites, make sure to provide a clear summary of how the project created value for our client, and ourselves. By providing a clear purpose of the content, the page visits we receive will be representative of people that are interested in getting the full story of the content. 
- Greater than 15% click rate on newsletter link, and >6% on Twitter repost. 
  * How: Grab the attention of potential readers by highlighting what a reader would gain by clicking the newsletter link- What would essential information would they be missing by simply reading a summary? How could they personally connect to the problems ourselves or our clients faced?

## Topics: 
It is important to not only showcase case studies that highlight our best work, but also our diversity of work. Include a case studies on nonprofit work we have done, unique projects from our clients, and studies that show the impact and success of our company culture, which can be done through interviewing past or present clients. 

- What to include for project based case study:
  * Introduction to the client company background
  * The situation (what problem did the client have?)
  * Process (what steps did Radial take to fix the problem?)
  * Outcome (what was the end product?)
  * Future (does Radial have future projects set up with that client?)

- What to include for culture based case study:
  * Client background: Paragraph style
  * List questions and answers of the interview (*make note that the interview has been edited and condensed for space and clarity). Questions to begin with: 
  * Why did you choose Radial?
  * What is the biggest thing you've gained from working with us?
  * How has working with Radial changed your culture in software?
  * What has been the hardest thing about working with Radial? What if anything has Radial done about it?
  * Note: Make sure to send your draft to the client you have interviewed after drafting the case study. You want to be sure that the content you have written correctly encaptures the the feelings and opinions of the client.
