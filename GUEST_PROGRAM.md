# Guest Program

The goal of having a guest program here at Radial is to welcome new people into our space
and get a chance to work with them. It makes hiring a simpler process when we take the opportunity
to talk with people and get to know them before making any final decisions. It's how we have
hired several of our current developers, and how we plan to hire more in the future.

## Management

The management of the guest program will be the responsibility of the Senior Developer of 
any given team.

It is the responsibility of the President of the company and the Director of Product Success 
to identify candidates that would have the best possible outcome and greatest possible impact
if they come to work with us.

The guests should be introduced to the Senior Developer by either the President of the company or 
the Director of Product Success.

At some point, the Senior Developer may tell the Director of Engineering to consider this person 
for hire. The Director of Engineering should then go through the interview process and screening
the candidate. The President of the company will make the final hiring decision.

There will also be a nondisclosure agreement, and this will include a mandated disclosure of 
conflicts of interest for all guests that work with us.

## Communication

Everyone at Radial should be given a heads up about the guest coming in, whether in person or 
over slack at least a few hours before the guest arrives. The senior developer should notify the 
team and ensure that the guest is well introduced when they come in.

In the short term, guests will be added to the Guest Help and Guest General channels on slack.
Every employee should turn on notifications to both of these channels.
