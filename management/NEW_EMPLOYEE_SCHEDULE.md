### First Sprint (Two weeks)

- Shadowing developers
  - The purpose of shadowing is to learn how and why we do things
  - The new employee should pair with other developers for the entire first sprint. During this time they should pair with a minimum of two different developers, and complete the checklist during this period.
  - After the first sprint it will be the employee's choice when to pair or work on their own.
