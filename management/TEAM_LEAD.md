# Team Lead Responsibilities

A Team Lead's role, in short, is to ensure that the team has what it needs to be successful in meeting goals for our clients. They must have the appropriate authority to fill that role. The following gives examples of the authority that a Team Lead has.

- When Developer Leads need help or advice about clients, they should approach their Team Lead first, who will escalate the issue as they deem necessary.

- Issues with policy or values-alignment should be addressed by the Team Lead, until they feel it needs to be escalated.

- For cross team issues, Team Leads should make upper management aware so they can handle it.

- Team Leads can decide to put a member of their team on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), but need to include the Director of Engineering in the process.

- Team Leads can decide to suspend a member of their team, but should check with the Director of Engineering in regards to schedule, to make sure commitments to clients can be met.

- When deciding whether to let someone go, the decision is Ben's but he will generally take the recommendation of the Team Lead.
