# Team Lead Responsibilities

A Team Lead's role, in short, is to ensure that the team has what it needs to be successful in meeting goals for our clients. They must have the appropriate authority to fill that role. The following gives examples of the authority that a Team Lead has.

- When Developer Leads need help or advice about clients, they should approach their Team Lead first, who will escalate the issue as they deem necessary.

- Issues with policy or values alignment should be addressed by the Team Lead, until they feel it needs to be escalated.

- Team Leads should make upper management aware of cross-team issues so they can handle it.

- Team Leads can decide to put a member of their team on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), but need to include the Director of Engineering in the process.

- We value all members of our team and want to work together so employees can be successful. We do not take actions such as suspension or letting someone go lightly, but sometimes this is the right choice for both parties. With that in mind:

  - Team Leads can decide to suspend a member of their team, However, they must coordinate this decision with the Director of Engineering to ensure that commitments to clients can continue to be met and additional accommodations for the team are adequately addressed.

  - When deciding whether to let someone go, the decision is the company owner's, but they will generally take the recommendation of the Team Lead.
