Hi (insert name),

Welcome to Radial Development Group!

To get you started, we have a few things to go over.

On your first day, remember to bring your ID documents and a laptop if possible. 

We will need to set you up with a handful of accounts. If you do not have a
GitHub account, making one with your personal email address before your first day will speed up the process.
You will need to set up
two-factor authentication on all of the accounts you make.

We are sending you your contract, W-4, I-9, and a direct deposit form to be filled
out. You can complete this step while at Radial.

Your Radial email address is (insert Radial email here) and your initial password
is (insert initial password). When you log in, you will also notice we have sent
you invites to use Noko and Asana. Please set up these accounts when you get the chance.

You will also be added to our Slack workspace, so downloading Slack to your
computer is definitely recommended before you arrive. https://slack.com/downloads/mac

Please let us know if you have any questions. We are excited to work with you!

Sincerely,

--The Radial Team
