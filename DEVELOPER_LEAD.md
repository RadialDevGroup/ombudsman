# Reporting Policy
My goal is to be able to keep track of high-level goals for projects and ensure that adequate and correct resourcing is available.  I also want to make sure we are functioning as a team to complete initiatives across projects.

I'm open to suggestions on how we best meet these goals, but for the main part, please let me know your goal and how you're doing every Friday.  This helps me with invoicing and resource management.  Beyond that, please keep me informed as you set sprint goals for your project and periodically when there is something worth reporting about that goal: completion, blockers, etc.

Sorry for all the back-and-forth on this.
