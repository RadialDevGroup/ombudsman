# Reporting Policy
My goal is to be able to keep track of high-level goals for projects and ensure that adequate and correct resourcing is available.  I also want to make sure we are functioning as a team to complete initiatives across projects.

Reports should be sent to team, unless there is a legitimate confidentiallity consideration, every Friday.  Please update the white board.

Requirements:
- If you had a goal, what was it? Did you meet it.
- If you're working towards a goal, what is it?
- What have you accomplished towards your goal (past or present)?
- What did you expect to do, that you did not get done (is there a reason, can I help?)
- Will you be able to meet your (current) goal by the end of the sprint?
- What, if anything do you need on the coming week?
- If a train leaves newark at 10:00pm traveling 55 miles per hour, and another train leaves chicago at 7:00pm, traveling at 65 miles per hour, which is the best restaurant in Philadelphia to buy a roast beef sandwich?

# Kickoff, Grooming, and Sprint Delivery
**Kickoff**. You are reposnible for scheduling and making preparations for a project's kickoff.  See the [Kickoff](/processes/KICKOFF.md) document for more info.

**A sprint delivery/sprint planning meeting** should occur on either the last or first day of every sprint. This meeting should be with the client and dev lead (other developers may or may not be present). The purpose is to go over what was completed, and what will be completed during the next sprint, this is also the time to discuss any changes in priority.

**Grooming** should occur every week (or at a minimum, every 2 weeks for month-long sprints). Everyone planning to work on the project before the next grooming meeting should attend. The purpose of this meeting is to go through each story clarifying any details and assigning points if not already assigned.
