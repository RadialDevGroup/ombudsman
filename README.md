# Policy

This is the authoritative company policy document.  Putting it in version control allows everyone to see and understand changes, as well as to contribute to improvements in the quality and scope of policy over time.

## Definitions
When "Management" is referenced, this will mean the individual who is currently
responsible for managing Radial Development Group. At this time, this individual
is Ben West.

## Structure
As Barbossa would say, the files in the Policy [wiki](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki) are intended to contain "guidelines" (and therefore do not require a PR review), while the Policy [repository](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy) is intended to contain "actual rules" (which should therefore be more seriously considered before they are changed).  Therefore, if you are looking for advice on how to accomplish a task related to your role at Radial, you most likely want to look at the wiki. On the other hand, if you are looking for documentation about HR concerns, company values, or the official company stance on which services we offer, you most likely want the repo. Employees are encouraged to PR a change to this structure if they feel a file is in the wrong place.
